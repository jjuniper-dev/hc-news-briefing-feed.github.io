‚Ä¢ How aging clocks can help us understand why we age‚Äîand if we can reverse it
  Be honest: Have you ever looked up someone from your childhood on social media with the sole intention of seeing how they‚Äôve aged?&nbsp;



One of my colleagues, who shall remain nameless, certainly has. He recently shared a photo of a former classmate. ‚ÄúCan you believe we‚Äôre the same age?‚Äù he asked, with a hint of glee in his voice. A relative also delights in this pastime. ‚ÄúWow, she looks like an old woman,‚Äù she‚Äôll say when looking at a picture of someone she has known since childhood. The years certainly are kinder to some of us than others.



But wrinkles and gray hairs aside, it can be difficult to know how well‚Äîor poorly‚Äîsomeone‚Äôs body is truly aging, under the hood. A person who develops age-related diseases earlier in life, or has other biological changes associated with aging (such as elevated cholesterol or markers of inflammation), might be considered ‚Äúbiologically older‚Äù than a similar-age person who doesn‚Äôt have those changes. Some 80-year-olds will be weak and frail, while others are fit and active.&nbsp;





Doctors have long used functional tests that measure their patients‚Äô strength or the distance they can walk, for example, or simply ‚Äúeyeball‚Äù them to guess whether they look fit enough to survive some treatment regimen, says Tamir Chandra, who studies aging at the Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;



But over the past decade, scientists have been uncovering new methods of looking at the hidden ways our bodies are aging. What they‚Äôve found is changing our understanding of aging itself.&nbsp;



‚ÄúAging clocks‚Äù are new scientific tools that can measure how our organs are wearing out, giving us insight into our mortality and health. They hint at our biological age. While chronological age is simply how many birthdays we‚Äôve had, biological age is meant to reflect something deeper. It measures how our bodies are handling the passing of time and‚Äîperhaps‚Äîlets us know how much more of it we have left. And while you can‚Äôt change your chronological age, you just might be able to influence your biological age.



It‚Äôs not just scientists who are using these clocks. Longevity influencers like Bryan Johnson often use them to make the case that they are aging backwards. ‚ÄúMy telomeres say I‚Äôm 10 years old,‚Äù Johnson posted on X in April. The Kardashians have tried them too (Khlo√© was told on TV that her biological age was 12 years below her chronological age). Even my local health-food store offers biological age testing. Some are pushing the use of clocks even further, using them to sell unproven ‚Äúanti-aging‚Äù supplements.



The science is still new, and few experts in the field‚Äîsome of whom affectionately refer to it as ‚Äúclock world‚Äù‚Äîwould argue that an aging clock can definitively reveal an individual‚Äôs biological age.&nbsp;



But their work is revealing that aging clocks can offer so much more than an insta-brag, a snake-oil pitch‚Äîor even just an eye-catching number. In fact, they are helping scientists unravel some of the deepest mysteries in biology: Why do we age? How do we age? When does aging begin? What does it even mean to age?



Ultimately, and most importantly, they might soon tell us whether we can reverse the whole process.



Clocks kick off



The way your genes work can change. Molecules called methyl groups can attach to DNA, controlling the way genes make proteins. This process is called methylation, and it can potentially occur at millions of points along the genome. These epigenetic markers, as they are known, can switch genes on or off, or increase or decrease how much protein they make. They‚Äôre not part of our DNA, but they influence how it works.



In 2011, Steve Horvath, then a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, took part in a study that was looking for links between sexual orientation and these epigenetic markers. Steve is straight; he says his twin brother, Markus, who also volunteered, is gay.



That study didn‚Äôt find a link between DNA methyl¬≠ation and sexual orientation. But when Horvath looked at the data, he noticed a different trend‚Äîa very strong link between age and methylation at around 88 points on the genome. He once told me he fell off his chair when he saw it.¬†



Many of the affected genes had already been linked to age-related brain and cardiovascular diseases, but it wasn‚Äôt clear how methylation might be related to those diseases.&nbsp;




If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.




In 2013, Horvath collected methylation data from 8,000 tissue and cell samples to create what he called the Horvath clock‚Äîessentially a mathematical model that could estimate age on the basis of DNA methylation at 353 points on the genome. From a tissue sample, it was able to detect a person‚Äôs age within a range of 2.9 years.



That clock changed everything. Its publication in 2013 marked the birth of ‚Äúclock world.‚Äù To some, the possibilities were almost endless. If a model could work out what average aging looks like, it could potentially estimate whether someone was aging unusually fast or slowly. It could transform medicine and fast-track the search for an anti-aging drug. It could help us understand what aging is, and why it happens at all.



The epigenetic clock was a success story in ‚Äúa field that, frankly, doesn‚Äôt have a lot of success stories,‚Äù says Jo√£o Pedro de Magalh√£es, who researches aging at the University of Birmingham, UK.



It took a few years, but as more aging researchers heard about the clock, they began incorporating it into their research and even developing their own clocks. Horvath became a bit of a celebrity. Scientists started asking for selfies with him at conferences, he says. Some researchers even made T-shirts bearing the front page of his 2013 paper.





Some of the many other aging clocks developed since have become notable in their own right. Examples include the PhenoAge clock, which incorporates health data such as blood cell counts and signs of inflammation along with methyl¬≠ation, and the Dunedin Pace of Aging clock, which tells you how quickly or slowly a person is aging rather than pointing to a specific age. Many of the clocks measure methylation, but some look at other variables, such as proteins in blood or certain carbohydrate molecules that attach to such proteins.



Today, there are hundreds or even thousands of clocks out there, says Chiara Herzog, who researches aging at King‚Äôs College London and is a member of the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium. Everyone has a favorite. Horvath himself favors his GrimAge clock, which was named after the Grim Reaper because it is designed to predict time to death.



That clock was trained on data collected from people who were monitored for decades, many of whom died in that period. Horvath won‚Äôt use it to tell people when they might die of old age, he stresses, saying that it wouldn‚Äôt be ethical. Instead, it can be used to deliver a biological age that hints at how long a person might expect to live. Someone who is 50 but has a GrimAge of 60 can assume that, compared with the average 50-year-old, they might be a bit closer to the end.



GrimAge is not perfect. While it can strongly predict time to death given the health trajectory someone is on, no aging clock can predict if someone will start smoking or get a divorce (which generally speeds aging) or suddenly take up running (which can generally slow it). ‚ÄúPeople are complicated,‚Äù Horvath tells MIT Technology Review. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge error bar.‚Äù



On the whole, the clocks are pretty good at making predictions about health and lifespan. They‚Äôve been able to predict that people over the age of 105 have lower biological ages, which tracks given how rare it is for people to make it past that age. A higher epigenetic age has been linked to declining cognitive function and signs of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, while better physical and cognitive fitness has been linked to a lower epigenetic age.



Black-box clocks



But accuracy is a challenge for all aging clocks. Part of the problem lies in how they were designed. Most of the clocks were trained to link age with methylation. The best clocks will deliver an estimate that reflects how far a person‚Äôs biology deviates from the average. Aging clocks are still judged on how well they can predict a person‚Äôs chronological age, but you don‚Äôt want them to be too close, says Lucas Paulo de Lima Camillo, head of machine learning at Shift Bioscience, who was awarded $10,000 by the Biomarkers of Aging Consortium for developing a clock that could estimate age within a range of 2.55 years.



None of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person. Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.LEON EDLER




‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this paradox,‚Äù says Camillo. If a clock is really good at predicting chronological age, that‚Äôs all it will tell you‚Äîand it probably won‚Äôt reveal much about your biological age. No one needs an aging clock to tell them how many birthdays they‚Äôve had. Camillo says he‚Äôs noticed that when the clocks get too close to ‚Äúperfect‚Äù age prediction, they actually become less accurate at predicting mortality.



Therein lies the other central issue for scientists who develop and use aging clocks: What is the thing they are really measuring? It is a difficult question for a field whose members notoriously fail to agree on the basics. (Everything from the definition of aging to how it occurs and why is up for debate among the experts.)



They do agree that aging is incredibly complex. A methylation-based aging clock might tell you about how that collection of chemical markers compares across individuals, but at best, it‚Äôs only giving you an idea of their ‚Äúepigenetic age,‚Äù says Chandra. There are probably plenty of other biological markers that might reveal other aspects of aging, he says: ‚ÄúNone of the clocks measure everything.‚Äù&nbsp;



We don‚Äôt know why some methyl groups appear or disappear with age, either. Are these changes causing damage? Or are they a by-product of it? Are the epigenetic patterns seen in a 90-year-old a sign of deterioration? Or have they been responsible for keeping that person alive into very old age?



To make matters even more complicated, two different clocks can give similar answers by measuring methylation at entirely different regions of the genome. No one knows why, or which regions might be the best ones to focus on.



‚ÄúThe biomarkers have this black-box quality,‚Äù says Jesse Poganik at Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital in Boston. ‚ÄúSome of them are probably causal, some of them may be adaptive ‚Ä¶ and some of them may just be neutral‚Äù: either ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no reason for them not to happen‚Äù or ‚Äúthey just happen by random chance.‚Äù



What we know is that, as things stand, none of the clocks are precise enough to predict the biological age of a single person (sorry, Khlo√©). Putting the same biological sample through five different clocks will give you five wildly different results.



Even the same clock can give you different answers if you put a sample through it more than once. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not yet individually predictive,‚Äù says Herzog. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know what [a clock result] means for a person, [or if] they‚Äôre more or less likely to develop disease.‚Äù



And it‚Äôs why plenty of aging researchers‚Äîeven those who regularly use the clocks in their work‚Äîhaven‚Äôt bothered to measure their own epigenetic age. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I do a clock and it says that my biological age ‚Ä¶ is five years older than it should be,‚Äù says Magalh√£es. ‚ÄúSo what?‚Äù He shrugs. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see much point in it.‚Äù



You might think this lack of clarity would make aging clocks pretty useless in a clinical setting. But plenty of clinics are offering them anyway. Some longevity clinics are more careful, and will regularly test their patients with a range of clocks, noting their results and tracking them over time. Others will simply offer an estimate of biological age as part of a longevity treatment package.



And then there are the people who use aging clocks to sell supplements. While no drug or supplement has been definitively shown to make people live longer, that hasn‚Äôt stopped the lightly regulated wellness industry from pushing a range of ‚Äútreatments‚Äù that range from lotions to herbal pills all the way through to stem-cell injections.



Some of these people come to aging meetings. I was in the audience at an event when one CEO took to the stage to claim he had reversed his own biological age by 18 years‚Äîthanks to the supplement he was selling. Tom Weldon of Ponce de Leon Health told us his gray hair was turning brown. His biological age was supposedly reversing so rapidly that he had reached ‚Äúlongevity escape velocity.‚Äù





But if the people who buy his supplements expect some kind of Benjamin Button effect, they might be disappointed. His company hasn‚Äôt yet conducted a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate any anti-aging effects of that supplement, called Rejuvant. Weldon says that such a trial would take years and cost millions of dollars, and that he‚Äôd ‚Äúhave to increase the price of our product more than four times‚Äù to pay for one. (The company has so far tested the active ingredient in mice and carried out a provisional trial in people.)



More generally, Horvath says he ‚Äúgets a bad taste in [his] mouth‚Äù when people use the clocks to sell products and ‚Äúmake a quick buck.‚Äù But he thinks that most of those sellers have genuine faith in both the clocks and their products. ‚ÄúPeople truly believe their own nonsense,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey are so passionate about what they discovered, they fall into this trap of believing [their] own prejudices.‚Äù&nbsp;



The accuracy of the clocks is at a level that makes them useful for research, but not for individual predictions. Even if a clock did tell someone they were five years younger than their chronological age, that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily mean the person could expect to live five years longer, says Magalh√£es. ‚ÄúThe field of aging has long been a rich ground for snake-oil salesmen and hype,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt comes with the territory.‚Äù (Weldon, for his part, says Rejuvant is the only product that has ‚Äúclinically meaningful‚Äù claims.)&nbsp;



In any case, Magalh√£es adds that he thinks any publicity is better than no publicity.



And there‚Äôs the rub. Most people in the longevity field seem to have mixed feelings about the trendiness of aging clocks and how they are being used. They‚Äôll agree that the clocks aren‚Äôt ready for consumer prime time, but they tend to appreciate the attention. Longevity research is expensive, after all. With a surge in funding and an explosion in the number of biotech companies working on longevity, aging scientists are hopeful that innovation and progress will follow.&nbsp;



So they want to be sure that the reputation of aging clocks doesn‚Äôt end up being tarnished by association. Because while influencers and supplement sellers are using their ‚Äúbiological ages‚Äù to garner attention, scientists are now using these clocks to make some remarkable discoveries. Discoveries that are changing the way we think about aging.



How to be young again



Two little mice lie side by side, anesthetized and unconscious, as Jim White prepares his scalpel. The animals are of the same breed but look decidedly different. One is a youthful three-month-old, its fur thick, black, and glossy. By comparison, the second mouse, a 20-month-old, looks a little the worse for wear. Its fur is graying and patchy. Its whiskers are short, and it generally looks kind of frail.



But the two mice are about to have a lot more in common. White, with some help from a colleague, makes incisions along the side of each mouse‚Äôs body and into the upper part of an arm and leg on the same side. He then carefully stitches the two animals together‚Äîmembranes, fascia, and skin.&nbsp;



The procedure takes around an hour, and the mice are then roused from their anesthesia. At first, the two still-groggy animals pull away from each other. But within a few days, they seem to have accepted that they now share their bodies. Soon their circulatory systems will fuse, and the animals will share a blood flow too.



‚ÄúPeople are complicated. There‚Äôs a huge error bar.‚Äù ‚Äî Steve Horvath, former biostatistician at the University of California, Los AngelesLEON EDLER




White, who studies aging at Duke University, has been stitching mice together for years; he has performed this strange procedure, known as heterochronic parabiosis, more than a hundred times. And he‚Äôs seen a curious phenomenon occur. The older mice appear to benefit from the arrangement. They seem to get younger.



Experiments with heterochronic parabiosis have been performed for decades, but typically scientists keep the mice attached to each other for only a few weeks, says White. In their experiment, he and his colleagues left the mice attached for three months‚Äîequivalent to around 10 human years. The team then carefully separated the animals to assess how each of them had fared. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd think that they‚Äôd want to separate immediately,‚Äù says White. ‚ÄúBut when you detach them ‚Ä¶ they kind of follow each other around.‚Äù



The most striking result of that experiment was that the older mice who had been attached to a younger mouse ended up living longer than other mice of a similar age. ‚Äú[They lived] around 10% longer, but [they] also maintained a lot of [their] function,‚Äù says White. They were more active and maintained their strength for longer, he adds.



When his colleagues, including Poganik, applied aging clocks to the mice, they found that their epigenetic ages were lower than expected. ‚ÄúThe young circulation slowed aging in the old mice,‚Äù says White. The effect seemed to last, too‚Äîat least for a little while. ‚ÄúIt preserved that youthful state for longer than we expected,‚Äù he says.



The young mice went the other way and appeared biologically older, both while they were attached to the old mice and shortly after they were detached. But in their case, the effect seemed to be short-lived, says White: ‚ÄúThe young mice went back to being young again.‚Äù&nbsp;



To White, this suggests that something about the ‚Äúyouthful state‚Äù might be programmed in some way. That perhaps it is written into our DNA. Maybe we don‚Äôt have to go through the biological process of aging.&nbsp;



This gets at a central debate in the aging field: What is aging, and why does it happen? Some believe it‚Äôs simply a result of accumulated damage. Some believe that the aging process is programmed; just as we grow limbs, develop a brain, reach puberty, and experience menopause, we are destined to deteriorate. Others think programs that play an important role in our early development just turn out to be harmful later in life by chance. And there are some scientists who agree with all of the above.



White‚Äôs theory is that being old is just ‚Äúa loss of youth,‚Äù he says. If that‚Äôs the case, there‚Äôs a silver lining: Knowing how youth is lost might point toward a way to somehow regain it, perhaps by restoring those youthful programs in some way.&nbsp;



Dogs and dolphins



Horvath‚Äôs eponymous clock was developed by measuring methylation in DNA samples taken from tissues around the body. It seems to represent aging in all these tissues, which is why Horvath calls it a pan-tissue clock. Given that our organs are thought to age differently, it was remarkable that a single clock could measure aging in so many of them.



But Horvath had ambitious plans for an even more universal clock: a pan-species model that could measure aging in all mammals. He started out, in 2017, with an email campaign that involved asking hundreds of scientists around the world to share samples of tissues from animals they had worked with. He tried zoos, too.&nbsp; &nbsp;




The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging‚Äînot just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.




‚ÄúI learned that people had spent careers collecting [animal] tissues,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThey had freezers full of [them].‚Äù Amenable scientists would ship those frozen tissues, or just DNA, to Horvath‚Äôs lab in California, where he would use them to train a new model.



Horvath says he initially set out to profile 30 different species. But he ended up receiving around 15,000 samples from 200 scientists, representing 348 species‚Äîincluding everything from dogs to dolphins. Could a single clock really predict age in all of them?



‚ÄúI truly felt it would fail,‚Äù says Horvath. ‚ÄúBut it turned out that I was completely wrong.‚Äù He and his colleagues developed a clock that assessed methylation at 36,000 locations on the genome. The result, which was published in 2023 as the pan-mammalian clock, can estimate the age of any mammal and even the maximum lifespan of the species. The data set is open to anyone who wants to download it, he adds: ‚ÄúI hope people will mine the data to find the secret of how to extend a healthy lifespan.‚Äù



The pan-mammalian clock suggests that there is something universal about aging‚Äînot just that all mammals experience it in a similar way, but that a similar set of genetic or epigenetic factors might be responsible for it.



Comparisons between mammals also support the idea that the slower methylation changes occur, the longer the lifespan of the animal, says Nelly Olova, an epigeneticist who researches aging at the University of Edinburgh in the UK. ‚ÄúDNA methylation slowly erodes with age,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe still have the instructions in place, but they become a little messier.‚Äù The research in different mammals suggests that cells can take only so much change before they stop functioning.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a finite amount of change that the cell can tolerate,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf the instructions become too messy and noisy ‚Ä¶ it cannot support life.‚Äù



Olova has been investigating exactly when aging clocks first begin to tick‚Äîin other words, the point at which aging starts. Clocks can be trained on data from volunteers, and by matching the patterns of methylation on their DNA to their chronological age. The trained clocks are then typically used to estimate the biological age of adults. But they can also be used on samples from children. Or babies. They can be used to work out the biological age of cells that make up embryos.&nbsp;



In her research, Olova used adult skin cells, which‚Äîthanks to Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning research in the 2000s‚Äîcan be ‚Äúreprogrammed‚Äù back to a state resembling that of the pluripotent stem cells found in embryos. When Olova and her colleagues used a ‚Äúpartial reprogramming‚Äù approach to take cells close to that state, they found that the closer they got to the entirely reprogrammed state, the ‚Äúyounger‚Äù the cells were.&nbsp;





It was around 20 days after the cells had been reprogrammed into stem cells that they reached the biological age of zero according to the clock used, says Olova. ‚ÄúIt was a bit surreal,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe pluripotent cells measure as minus 0.5; they‚Äôre slightly below zero.‚Äù



Vadim Gladyshev, a prominent aging researcher at Harvard University, has since proposed that the same negative level of aging might apply to embryos. After all, some kind of rejuvenation happens during the early stages of embryo formation‚Äîan aged egg cell and an aged sperm cell somehow create a brand-new cell. The slate is wiped clean.



Gladyshev calls this point ‚Äúground zero.‚Äù He posits that it‚Äôs reached sometime during the ‚Äúmid-embryonic state.‚Äù At this point, aging begins. And so does ‚Äúorganismal life,‚Äù he argues. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting how this coincides with philosophical questions about when life starts,‚Äù says Olova.¬†



Some have argued that life begins when sperm meets egg, while others have suggested that the point when embryonic cells start to form some kind of unified structure is what counts. The ground zero point is when the body plan is set out and cells begin to organize accordingly, she says. ‚ÄúBefore that, it‚Äôs just a bunch of cells.‚Äù



This doesn‚Äôt mean that life begins at the embryonic state, but it does suggest that this is when aging begins‚Äîperhaps as the result of ‚Äúa generational clearance of damage,‚Äù says Poganik.



It is early days‚Äîno pun intended‚Äîfor this research, and the science is far from settled. But knowing when aging begins could help inform attempts to rewind the clock. If scientists can pinpoint an ideal biological age for cells, perhaps they can find ways to get old cells back to that state. There might be a way to slow aging once cells reach a certain biological age, too.&nbsp;



‚ÄúPresumably, there may be opportunities for targeting aging before ‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre full of gray hair,‚Äù says Poganik. ‚ÄúIt could mean that there is an ideal window for intervention which is much earlier than our current geriatrics-based approach.‚Äù



When young meets old



When White first started stitching mice together, he would sit and watch them for hours. ‚ÄúI was like, look at them go! They‚Äôre together, and they don‚Äôt even care!‚Äù he says. Since then, he‚Äôs learned a few tricks. He tends to work with female mice, for instance‚Äîthe males tend to bicker and nip at each other, he says. The females, on the other hand, seem to get on well.&nbsp;



The effect their partnership appears to have on their biological ages, if only temporarily, is among the ways aging clocks are helping us understand that biological age is plastic to some degree. White and his colleagues have also found, for instance, that stress seems to increase biological age, but that the effect can be reversed once the stress stops. Both pregnancy and covid-19 infections have a similar reversible effect.



Poganik wonders if this finding might have applications for human organ transplants. Perhaps there‚Äôs a way to measure the biological age of an organ before it is transplanted and somehow rejuvenate organs before surgery.&nbsp;



But new data from aging clocks suggests that this might be more complicated than it sounds. Poganik and his colleagues have been using methylation clocks to measure the biological age of samples taken from recently transplanted hearts in living people.&nbsp;




If being old is simply a case of losing our youthfulness, then that might give us a clue to how we can somehow regain it.




Young hearts do well in older bodies, but the biological age of these organs eventually creeps up to match that of their recipient. The same is true for older hearts in younger bodies, says Poganik, who has not yet published his findings. ‚ÄúAfter a few months, the tissue may assimilate the biological age of the organism,‚Äù he says.&nbsp;



If that‚Äôs the case, the benefits of young organs might be short-lived. It also suggests that scientists working on ways to rejuvenate individual organs may need to focus their anti-aging efforts on more systemic means of rejuvenation‚Äîfor example, stem cells that repopulate the blood. Reprogramming these cells to a youthful state, perhaps one a little closer to ‚Äúground zero,‚Äù might be the way to go.



Whole-body rejuvenation might be some way off, but scientists are still hopeful that aging clocks might help them find a way to reverse aging in people.



‚ÄúWe have the machinery to reset our epigenetic clock to a more youthful state,‚Äù says White. ‚ÄúThat means we have the ability to turn the clock backwards.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Can we repair the internet?
  From addictive algorithms to exploitative apps, data mining to misinformation, the internet today can be a hazardous place. Books by three influential figures‚Äîthe intellect behind ‚Äúnet neutrality,‚Äù a former Meta executive, and the web‚Äôs own inventor‚Äîpropose radical approaches to fixing it. But are these luminaries the right people for the job? Though each shows conviction, and even sometimes inventiveness, the solutions they present reveal blind spots.



The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future ProsperityTim WuKNOPF, 2025




In The Age of Extraction: How Tech Platforms Conquered the Economy and Threaten Our Future Prosperity, Tim Wu argues that a few platform companies have too much concentrated power and must be dismantled. Wu, a prominent Columbia professor who popularized the principle that a free internet requires all online traffic to be treated equally, believes that existing legal mechanisms, especially anti-monopoly laws, offer the best way to achieve this goal.



Pairing economic theory with recent digital history, Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving to users to extracting from them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow, displacing competitors along the way. And he contends that convenience is what platforms most often exploit to keep users entrapped. ‚ÄúThe human desire to avoid unnecessary pain and inconvenience,‚Äù he writes, may be ‚Äúthe strongest force out there.‚Äù



He cites Google‚Äôs and Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúecosystems‚Äù as examples, showing how users can become dependent on such services as a result of their all-¬≠encompassing seamlessness. To Wu, this isn‚Äôt a bad thing in itself. The ease of using Amazon to stream entertainment, make online purchases, or help organize day-to-day life delivers obvious gains. But when powerhouse companies like Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet win the battle of convenience with so many users‚Äîand never let competitors get a foothold‚Äîthe result is ‚Äúindustry dominance‚Äù that must now be reexamined.



The measures Wu advocates‚Äîand that appear the most practical, as they draw on existing legal frameworks and economic policies‚Äîare federal anti-monopoly laws, utility caps that limit how much companies can charge consumers for service, and ‚Äúline of business‚Äù restrictions that prohibit companies from operating in certain industries.




Columbia University‚Äôs Tim Wu shows how platforms have shifted from giving to users to extracting from them. He argues that our failure to understand their power has only encouraged them to grow.




Anti-monopoly provisions and antitrust laws are effective weapons in our armory, Wu contends, pointing out that they have been successfully used against technology companies in the past. He cites two well-known cases. The first is the 1960s antitrust case brought by the US government against IBM, which helped create competition in the computer software market that enabled companies like Apple and Microsoft to emerge. The 1982 AT&amp;T case that broke the telephone conglomerate up into several smaller companies is another instance. In each, the public benefited from the decoupling of hardware, software, and other services, leading to more competition and choice in a technology market.





But will past performance predict future results? It‚Äôs not yet clear whether these laws can be successful in the platform age. The 2025 antitrust case against Google‚Äîin which a judge ruled that the company did not have to divest itself of its Chrome browser as the US Justice Department had proposed‚Äîreveals the limits of pursuing tech breakups through the law. The 2001 antitrust case brought against Microsoft likewise failed to separate the company from its web browser and mostly kept the conglomerate intact. Wu noticeably doesn‚Äôt discuss the Microsoft case when arguing for antitrust action today.



Nick Clegg, until recently Meta‚Äôs president of global affairs and a former deputy prime minister of the UK, takes a position very different from Wu‚Äôs: that trying to break up the biggest tech companies is misguided and would degrade the experience of internet users. In How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political Conflict, Clegg acknowledges Big Tech‚Äôs monopoly over the web. But he believes punitive legal measures like antitrust laws are unproductive and can be avoided by means of regulation, such as rules for what content social media can and can‚Äôt publish. (It‚Äôs worth noting that Meta is facing its own antitrust case, involving whether it should have been allowed to acquire Instagram and WhatsApp.)



How to Save the Internet: The Threat to Global Connection in the Age of AI and Political ConflictNick CleggBODLEY HEAD, 2025




Clegg also believes Silicon Valley should take the initiative to reform itself. He argues that encouraging social media networks to ‚Äúopen up the books‚Äù and share their decision-making power with users is more likely to restore some equilibrium than contemplating legal action as a first resort.



But some may be skeptical of a former Meta exec and politician who worked closely with Mark Zuckerberg and still wasn‚Äôt able to usher in such changes to social media sites while working for one. What will only compound this skepticism is the selective history found in Clegg‚Äôs book, which briefly acknowledges some scandals (like the one surrounding Cambridge Analytica‚Äôs data harvesting from Facebook users in 2016) but refuses to discuss other pertinent ones. For example, Clegg laments the ‚Äúfractured‚Äù nature of the global internet today but fails to acknowledge Facebook‚Äôs own role in this splintering.



Breaking up Big Tech through antitrust laws would hinder innovation, says Clegg, arguing that the idea ‚Äúcompletely ignores the benefits users gain from large network effects.‚Äù Users stick with these outsize channels because they can find ‚Äúmost of what they‚Äôre looking for,‚Äù he writes, like friends and content on social media and cheap consumer goods on Amazon and eBay.



Wu might concede this point, but he would disagree with Clegg‚Äôs claims that maintaining the status quo is beneficial to users. ‚ÄúThe traditional logic of antitrust law doesn‚Äôt work,‚Äù Clegg insists. Instead, he believes less sweeping regulation can help make Big Tech less dangerous while ensuring a better user experience.



Clegg has seen both sides of the regulatory coin: He worked in David Cameron‚Äôs government passing national laws for technology companies to follow and then moved to Meta to help the company navigate those types of nation-specific obligations. He bemoans the hassle and complexity Silicon Valley faces in trying to comply with differing rules across the globe, some set by ‚ÄúAmerican federal agencies‚Äù and others by ‚ÄúIndian nationalists.‚Äù



But with the resources such companies command, surely they are more than equipped to cope? Given that Meta itself has previously meddled in access to the internet (such as in India, whose telecommunications regulator ultimately blocked its Free Basics internet service for violating net neutrality rules), this complaint seems suspect coming from Clegg. What should be the real priority, he argues, is not any new nation-specific laws but a global ‚Äútreaty that protects the free flow of data between signatory countries.‚Äù




What the former Meta executive Nick Clegg advocates‚Äîunsurprisingly‚Äîis not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become ‚Äúradically transparent.‚Äù




Clegg believes that these nation-specific technology obligations‚Äîa recent one is Australia‚Äôs ban on social media for people under 16‚Äîusually reflect fallacies about the technology‚Äôs human impact, a subject that can be fraught with anxiety. Such laws have proved ineffective and tend to taint the public‚Äôs understanding of social networks, he says. There is some truth to his argument here, but reading a book in which a former Facebook executive dismisses techno-determinism‚Äîthat is, the argument that technology makes people do or think certain things‚Äîmay be cold comfort to those who have seen the harm technology can do.



In any case, Clegg‚Äôs defensiveness about social networks may not gain much favor from users themselves. He stresses the need for more personal responsibility, arguing that Meta doesn‚Äôt ever intend for users to stay on Facebook or Instagram endlessly: ‚ÄúHow long you spend on the app in a single session is not nearly as important as getting you to come back over and over again.‚Äù Social media companies want to serve you content that is ‚Äúmeaningful to you,‚Äù he claims, not ‚Äúsimply to give you a momentary dopamine spike.‚Äù All this feels disingenuous at best.



What Clegg advocates‚Äîunsurprisingly‚Äîis not a breakup of Big Tech but a push for it to become ‚Äúradically transparent,‚Äù whether on its own or, if necessary, with the help of federal legislators. He also wants platforms to bring users more into their governance processes (by using Facebook‚Äôs model of community forums to help improve their apps and products, for example). Finally, Clegg also wants Big Tech to give users more meaningful control of their data and how companies such as Meta can use it.



Here Clegg shares common ground with the inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, whose own proposal for reform advances a technically specific vision for doing just that. In his memoir/manifesto This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide Web, Berners-Lee acknowledges that his initial vision‚Äîof a technology he hoped would remain open-source, collaborative, and completely decentralized‚Äîis a far cry from the web that we know today.



This Is for Everyone: The Unfinished Story of the World Wide WebTim Berners-LeeFARRAR, STRAUS &#038; GIROUX, 2025




If there‚Äôs any surviving manifestation of his original project, he says, it‚Äôs Wikipedia, which remains ‚Äúprobably the best single example of what I wanted the web to be.‚Äù His best idea for moving power from Silicon Valley platforms into the hands of users is to give them more data control. He pushes for a universal data ‚Äúpod‚Äù he helped develop, known as ‚ÄúSolid‚Äù (an abbreviation of ‚Äúsocial linked data‚Äù).



The system‚Äîwhich was originally developed at MIT‚Äîwould offer a central site where people could manage data ranging from credit card information to health records to social media comment history. ‚ÄúRather than have all this stuff siloed off with different providers across the web, you‚Äôd be able to store your entire digital information trail in a single private repository,‚Äù Berners-Lee writes.



The Solid product may look like a kind of silver bullet in an age when data harvesting is familiar and data breaches are rampant. Placing greater control with users and enabling them to see ‚Äúwhat data [i]s being generated about them‚Äù does sound like a tantalizing prospect.



But some people may have concerns about, for example, merging their confidential health records with data from personal devices (like heart rate info from a smart watch). No matter how much user control and decentralization Berners-Lee may promise, recent data scandals (such as cases in which period-tracking apps misused clients‚Äô data) may be on people‚Äôs minds.





Berners-Lee believes that centralizing user data in a product like Solid could save people time and improve daily life on the internet. ‚ÄúAn alien coming to Earth would think it was very strange that I had to tell my phone the same things again and again,‚Äù he complains about the experience of using different airline apps today.



With Solid, everything from vaccination records to credit card transactions could be kept within the digital vault and plugged into different apps. Berners-Lee believes that AI could also help people make more use of this data‚Äîfor example, by linking meal plans to grocery bills. Still, if he‚Äôs optimistic on how AI and Solid could coordinate to improve users‚Äô lives, he is vague on how to make sure that chatbots manage such personal data sensitively and safely.



Berners-Lee generally opposes regulation of the web (except in the case of teenagers and social media algorithms, where he sees a genuine need). He believes in internet users‚Äô individual right to control their own data; he is confident that a product like Solid could ‚Äúcourse-correct‚Äù the web from its current ‚Äúexploitative‚Äù and extractive direction.



Of the three writers‚Äô approaches to reform, it is Wu‚Äôs that has shown some effectiveness of late. Companies like Google have been forced to give competitors some advantage through data sharing, and they have now seen limits on how their systems can be used in new products and technologies. But in the current US political climate, will antitrust laws continue to be enforced against Big Tech?



Clegg may get his way on one issue: limiting new nation-specific laws. President Donald Trump has confirmed that he will use tariffs to penalize countries that ratify their own national laws targeting US tech companies. And given the posture of the Trump administration, it doesn‚Äôt seem likely that Big Tech will see more regulation in the US. Indeed, social networks have seemed emboldened (Meta, for example, removed fact-checkers and relaxed content moderation rules after Trump‚Äôs election win). In any case, the US hasn‚Äôt passed a major piece of federal internet legislation since 1996.



If using anti-monopoly laws through the courts isn‚Äôt possible, Clegg‚Äôs push for a US-led omnibus deal‚Äîsetting consensual rules for data and acceptable standards of human rights‚Äîmay be the only way to make some more immediate improvements.



In the end, there is not likely to be any single fix for what ails the internet today. But the ideas the three writers agree on‚Äîgreater user control, more data privacy, and increased accountability from Silicon Valley‚Äîare surely the outcomes we should all fight for.

‚Ä¢ An Earthling‚Äôs guide to planet hunting
  The pendant on Rebecca Jensen-Clem‚Äôs necklace is only about an inch wide, composed of 36 silver hexagons entwined in a honeycomb mosaic. At the Keck Observatory, in Hawaii, just as many segments make up a mirror that spans 33 feet, reflecting images of uncharted worlds for her to study.&nbsp;



Jensen-Clem, an astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, works with the Keck Observatory to figure out how to detect new planets without leaving our own. Typically, this pursuit faces an array of obstacles: Wind, fluctuations in atmospheric density and temperature, or even a misaligned telescope mirror can create a glare from a star‚Äôs light that obscures the view of what‚Äôs around it, rendering any planets orbiting the star effectively invisible. And what light Earth‚Äôs atmosphere doesn‚Äôt obscure, it absorbs. That‚Äôs why researchers who study these distant worlds often work with space telescopes that circumvent Earth‚Äôs pesky atmosphere entirely, such as the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope.&nbsp;





But there‚Äôs another way over these hurdles. At her lab among the redwoods, Jensen-Clem and her students experiment with new technologies and software to help Keck‚Äôs primary honeycomb mirror and its smaller, ‚Äúdeformable‚Äù mirror see more clearly. Using measurements from atmospheric sensors, deformable mirrors are designed to adjust shape rapidly, so they can correct for distortions caused by Earth‚Äôs atmosphere on the fly.&nbsp;



This general imaging technique, called adaptive optics, has been common practice since the 1990s. But Jensen-Clem is looking to level up the game with extreme adaptive optics technologies, which are aimed to create the highest image quality over a small field of view. Her group, in particular, does so by tackling issues involving wind or the primary mirror itself. The goal is to focus starlight so precisely that a planet can be visible even if its host star is a million to a billion times brighter.



In April, she and her former collaborator Maaike van Kooten were named co-recipients of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation‚Äôs New Horizons in Physics Prize. The prize announcement says they earned this early-career research award for their potential ‚Äúto enable the direct detection of the smallest exo¬≠planets‚Äù through a repertoire of methods the two women have spent their careers developing.&nbsp;



In July, Jensen-Clem was also announced as a member of a new committee for the Habitable Worlds Observatory, a concept for a NASA space telescope that would spend its career on the prowl for signs of life in the universe. She‚Äôs tasked with defining the mission‚Äôs scientific goals by the end of the decade.

‚ÄúIn adaptive optics, we spend a lot of time on simulations, or in the lab,‚Äù Jensen-Clem says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long road to see that I‚Äôve actually made things better at the observatory in the past few years.‚Äù



Jensen-Clem has long appreciated astronomy for its more mind-bending qualities. In seventh grade, she became fascinated by how time slows down near a black hole when her dad, an aerospace engineer, explained that concept to her. After starting her bachelor‚Äôs degree at MIT in 2008, she became taken with how a distant star can seem to disappear‚Äîeither suddenly winking out or gently fading away, depending on the kind of object that passes in front of it. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt quite exoplanet science, but there was a lot of overlap,‚Äù she says.




‚ÄúIf you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it‚Äôs happening fast. So we have to go fast too.‚Äù




During this time, Jensen-Clem began sowing the seeds for one of her prize-winning methods after her teaching assistant recommended that she apply for an internship at NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory. There, she worked on a setup that could perfect the orientation of a large mirror. Such mirrors are more difficult to realign than the smaller, deformable ones, whose shape-changing segments cater to Earth‚Äôs fluctuating atmosphere.



‚ÄúAt the time, we were saying, ‚ÄòOh, wouldn‚Äôt it be really cool to install one of these at Keck Observatory?‚Äô‚Äù Jensen-Clem says. The idea stuck around. She even wrote about it in a fellowship application when she was gearing up to start her graduate work at Caltech. And after years of touch-and-go development, Jensen-Clem succeeded in installing the system‚Äîwhich uses a technology called a Zernike wavefront sensor‚Äîon Keck‚Äôs primary mirror about a year ago. ‚ÄúMy work as a college intern is finally done,‚Äù she says.&nbsp;





The system, which is currently used for occasional recalibrations rather than continuous adjustments, includes a special kind of glass plate that bends the light rays from the mirror to reveal a specific pattern. The detector can pick up a hairbreadth misalignment in that picture: If one hexagon is pushed too far back or forward, its brightness changes. Even the tiniest misalignment is important to correct, because ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre studying a faint object, suddenly you‚Äôre much more susceptible to little mistakes,‚Äù Jensen-Clem says.



She has also been working to perfect the craft of molding Keck‚Äôs deformable mirror. This instrument, which reflects light that‚Äôs been rerouted from the primary mirror, is much smaller‚Äîonly six inches wide‚Äîand is designed to reposition as often as 2,000 times a second to combat atmospheric turbulence and create the clearest picture possible. ‚ÄúIf you just look up at the night sky and see stars twinkling, it‚Äôs happening fast. So we have to go fast too,‚Äù Jensen-Clem says.&nbsp;



Even at this rapid rate of readjustment, there‚Äôs still a lag. The deformable mirror is usually about one millisecond behind the actual outdoor conditions at any given time. ‚ÄúWhen the [adaptive optics] system can‚Äôt keep up,&nbsp;then you aren‚Äôt going to get the best resolution,‚Äù says van Kooten, Jensen-Clem‚Äôs former collaborator, who is now at the National Research Council Canada. This lag has proved especially troublesome on windy nights.&nbsp;



Jensen-Clem thought it was an unsolvable problem. ‚ÄúThe reason we have that delay is because we need to run computations and then move the deformable mirror,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre never going to do those things instantaneously.‚Äù





But while she was still a postdoc at UC Berkeley, she came across a paper that posited a solution. Its authors proposed that using previous measurements and simple algebra to predict how the atmosphere will change, rather than trying to keep up with it in real time, would yield better results. She wasn‚Äôt able to test the idea at the time, but coming to UCSC and working with Keck presented the perfect opportunity.&nbsp;



Around this time, Jensen-Clem invited van Kooten to join her team at UCSC as a postdoc because of their shared interest in the predictive software. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have a place to live at first, so she put me up in her guest room,‚Äù van Kooten says. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just so supportive at every level.‚Äù



After creating experimental software to try out at Keck, the team compared the predictive version with the more standard adaptive optics, examining how well each imaged an exoplanet without its drowning in starlight. They found that the predictive software could image even faint exoplanets two to three times more clearly. The results, which Jensen-Clem published in 2022, were part of what earned her the New Horizons in Physics Prize.&nbsp;



Thayne Currie, an astronomer at the University of Texas, San Antonio, says that these new techniques will become especially vital as researchers build bigger and bigger ground-based facilities to capture images of exoplanets‚Äîincluding upcoming projects such as the Extremely Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an incredible amount that we‚Äôre learning&nbsp;about the universe, and it is really driven by technology advances that are very, very&nbsp;new,‚Äù Currie says. ‚ÄúDr. Jensen-Clem‚Äôs work is an example of that kind of innovation.‚Äù



In May, one of Jensen-Clem‚Äôs graduate students went back to Hawaii to reinstall the predictive software at Keck. This time, the program isn‚Äôt just a trial run; it‚Äôs there to stay. The new software has shown it can refocus artificial starlight. Next, it will have to prove it can handle the real thing.&nbsp;





And in about a year, Jensen-Clem and her students and colleagues will brace themselves for a flood of observations from the European Space Agency‚Äôs Gaia mission, which recently finished measuring the motion, temperature, and composition of billions of stars over more than a decade.&nbsp;



When the project releases its next set of data‚Äîslated for December 2026‚ÄîJensen-Clem‚Äôs team aims to hunt for new exoplanetary systems using clues like the wobbles in a star‚Äôs motion caused by the gravitational tugs of planets orbiting around it. Once a system has been identified, exoplanet photographers will then be able to shoot the hidden planets using a new instrument at Keck that can reveal more about their atmospheres and temperatures.&nbsp;



There will be a mountain of data to sort through, and an even steeper supply of starlight to refocus. Thankfully, Jensen-Clem has spent more than a decade refining just the techniques she‚Äôll need: ‚ÄúThis time next year,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be racing to throw all our adaptive optics tricks at these systems and detect as many of these objects as possible.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ DDoS Botnet Aisuru Blankets US ISPs in Record DDoS
  The world&#8217;s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.
Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.
The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.
As Aisuru&#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru, which was then the largest assault that Google&#8217;s DDoS protection service Project Shield had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.
By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.

Aisuru&#8217;s overlords aren&#8217;t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like Minecraft, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.
For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.
Steven Ferguson is principal security engineer at Global Secure Layer (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts TCPShield, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.
Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider OVH that they were no longer welcome as a customer.
&#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.
Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru attacks on gaming servers can be still seen at the website blockgametracker.gg, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.
An Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28¬† can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.
Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider Cosmic (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.

BOTNETS R US
Ferguson said he&#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.
AT&amp;T customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on Charter Communications, Comcast, T-Mobile and Verizon, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.
&#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&#8221; Ferguson said. &#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&#8221;
Roland Dobbins is principal engineer at Netscout. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.
&#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&#8221; Dobbin said. &#8220;We&#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&#8221;
&#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&#8221; Dobbins continued. &#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&#8221;
KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to a recent blog post on protecting its network, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.
&#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&#8221;
A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&#8221;
9 YEARS OF MIRAI
Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was leaked in 2016¬†by the original creators of the Mirai IoT botnet. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016.
The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.

Dobbins said Aisuru&#8217;s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.
&#8220;The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And that&#8217;s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.&#8221;
The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &#8220;9gigsofram,&#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called Proxypipe that was heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters.
Robert Coelho co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner Erik &#8220;9gigsofram&#8221; Buckingham, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.
&#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&#8221; Coelho said.
Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.
&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&#8221; he said.
RAPID SPREAD
Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. XLab, the Chinese security company that was the first to profile Aisuru&#8217;s rise in 2024, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for Totolink, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.
&#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&#8221; XLab wrote on September 15. &#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&#8221;
A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.
Aisuru&#8217;s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the U.S. Department Justice¬†charged the alleged proprietor of Rapper Bot, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.
Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru&#8217;s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government&#8217;s takedown, Dobbins said.
&#8220;Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that&#8217;s great, but unfortunately the botnet&#8217;s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.&#8221;
A screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name &#8220;Ethan J. Foltz&#8221; in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.
BOTMASTERS AT LARGE
XLab&#8217;s September blog post cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: &#8220;Snow,&#8221; who&#8217;s responsible for botnet development; &#8220;Tom,&#8221; tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and &#8220;Forky,&#8221; responsible for botnet sales.
KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our May 2025 story about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky&#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.

Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called Botshield. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP‚Äôs clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.
In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.
Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).
But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.
At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,&#8221; Forky replied. &#8220;They&#8217;re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.&#8221;

The Physical AI spectrum: from automation to true intelligence 
 
As organizations evaluate their Physical AI initiatives, understanding where different solutions fall on the capability spectrum is crucial for strategic planning. Each level represents a distinct leap in autonomy and sophistication: 
 
 Level 1: Basic Physical Automation:&nbsp;This foundational stage involves systems that perform predefined tasks in tightly controlled environments. Think of industrial robots on assembly lines‚Äîhighly efficient, but rigid and entirely dependent on human programming and oversight. 
 Level 2: Adaptive Physical Automation:&nbsp;At this stage, systems gain flexibility in task sequencing. While individual actions are still preprogrammed, they can adjust their order based on real-time environmental cues. Collaborative robots that change behavior when humans are nearby is a prime example. 
 Level 3: Partially Autonomous Physical AI:&nbsp;Here, systems demonstrate intelligent behavior, including planning, executing, and adapting tasks with limited human input. Robots that learn new processes through demonstration highlight this emerging autonomy. 
 Level 4: Fully Autonomous Physical AI:&nbsp;The most advanced level features systems capable of operating across varied domains with minimal supervision. These systems adapt fluidly to new scenarios and environmental changes. Although most commercial solutions remain at Levels 1 or 2, momentum toward full autonomy is accelerating. 
 
Enabling technologies: the building blocks of Physical AI 
The progression from basic automation to full autonomy requires sophisticated technological foundations. Several key innovations are driving this evolution: 
 
 Advanced control theory facilitates precise and reliable actuation. 
 High-fidelity perception models, powered by multimodal sensors, enable machines to interpret complex environments. 
 Edge AI accelerators support real-time inference at the point of action, crucial for latency-sensitive tasks. 
 Foundation models, trained on multimodal datasets, help provide generalizable intelligence across domains. 
 Digital twin systems play a pivotal role in enabling simulation, validation, and optimization of physical systems before real-world deployment, significantly accelerating development cycles. 
 
Industry forces and investment momentum 
Physical AI sits at the intersection of multiple high-growth industries, with the AI Robots sector alone projected to reach a staggering $124.26 billion by 2034. Alongside this, the closely related Digital Twin Technology industry is set to hit an even more impressive $379 billion in the same timeframe. These projections signal a fundamental shift in how enterprises approach automation, efficiency, and digital transformation. 
Investors are keenly aware of this potential, focusing their attention on several key themes within the Physical AI space. Humanoid robotics has emerged as a particularly exciting frontier, with startups securing substantial funding rounds to develop general-purpose robotic workers capable of seamlessly operating in environments designed for humans. Simultaneously, there‚Äôs growing interest in foundation models for robotics ‚Äì the development of sophisticated ‚Äúrobot brains‚Äù that can adapt to various tasks and control diverse robotic systems. This push towards more flexible, intelligent systems is complemented by continued investment in vertical-specific applications, where companies are leveraging Physical AI to address acute industry challenges, from streamlining warehouse logistics to revolutionizing agricultural practices. The breadth of Physical AI‚Äôs potential is further demonstrated by emerging applications in fields as diverse as surgical robotics, autonomous delivery systems, and advanced defense technologies. This expansion into new domains underscores the versatility and transformative power of Physical AI across sectors. 
Real-world impact: quantifying the Physical AI transformation 
While investment trends signal strong future potential, Physical AI is already delivering concrete results across industries. For example, Amazon‚Äôs&nbsp;supply chain has boosted efficiency by 25% through intelligent automation, while Foxconn cut manufacturing deployment times by 40%. In healthcare, AI-assisted procedures have led to 30% fewer complications and 25% shorter surgery durations, showcasing transformative outcomes. 
According to a 2024 AI in manufacturing &amp; energy report, 64% of manufacturers using AI in production already report positive ROI, with nearly one-third expecting returns of $2 to $5 for every dollar invested. These gains translate into efficiency improvements between 20-40%, cost savings of 15-30%, and the rise of innovative business models like Robot-as-a-Service. 
In retail, digital twins are being used to explore the impact of different store layouts on shopper behavior and to test the integration of Physical AI with autonomous inventory management systems, helping retailers optimize their physical spaces and operations. Meanwhile, agriculture benefits from advancements in precision farming, crop monitoring, and automated harvesting‚Äîfurther highlighting Physical AI‚Äôs broad and growing impact. 
The next frontier

‚Ä¢ Medical reports analysis dashboard using Amazon Bedrock, LangChain, and Streamlit
  In healthcare, the ability to quickly analyze and interpret medical reports is crucial for both healthcare providers and patients. While medical reports contain valuable information, they often remain underutilized due to their complex nature and the time-intensive process of analysis. This complexity manifests in several ways: the interpretation of multiple parameters and their relationships (such as various blood cell counts), the comparison of test results against standard reference ranges, and the need to analyze trends in health parameters over time. To address this challenge, we‚Äôve conceptualized a medical reports analysis dashboard that illustrates how healthcare providers could enhance their interaction with medical data through a sample implementation 
In this post, the created dashboard represents a convergent solution that brings together the power of Amazon Bedrock advanced AI capabilities, LangChain‚Äòs document processing, and Streamlit‚Äòs intuitive user interface. By using these technologies, we‚Äôve created a system that not only stores and displays medical reports, but actively helps interpret them through natural language interactions and dynamic visualizations. 
Solution overview 
At the solution‚Äôs foundation are various large language models available through Amazon Bedrock, including Anthropic‚Äôs Claude series and Amazon Nova Foundation Models. You can select from options such as Claude Opus 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Amazon Nova Pro, and others, each optimized for different performance and capability requirements. The chosen model processes natural language queries with medical context awareness, enabling detailed interpretation of healthcare data. With this flexibility, you can balance factors like accuracy, speed, and cost based on your specific needs. This is enhanced by LangChain‚Äôs document processing capabilities, which manage the retrieval system and maintain conversation context, facilitating accurate and relevant responses. 
The solution‚Äôs data flow begins with medical reports securely stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), which are then processed through LangChain‚Äôs document handling system. When you interact with the Streamlit frontend, your queries are analyzed by Amazon Bedrock, while LangChain maintains the conversation context and manages document retrieval. The system processes this information and presents results through an intuitive interface featuring interactive visualizations. 
These visualizations, powered by Plotly, include range comparison charts that clearly display normal versus actual values, bar charts for parameter comparisons, and trend lines for tracking changes over time. The Streamlit interface ties everything together, providing real-time interaction with the AI system while managing user session state and conversation history. This comprehensive approach helps ensure that medical professionals can quickly access, analyze, and interpret their medical reports through natural language queries while viewing supporting visual data. 
The following is the architecture diagram of the solution that has four layers: 
 
 User Interface Layer: Streamlit Web App, Chat interface, Plotly data visualizations 
 Processing Layer: LangChain document processing, Conversation retrieval chain, Data parsing 
 AI/ML Layer: Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Bedrock embeddings, In-memory vector store 
 Storage Layer: Amazon S3 for medical reports, Conversation buffer memory 
 
 
Prerequisites 
Before deploying the Medical Reports Analysis Dashboard, you need: 
 
 An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access enabled 
 AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permission for Amazon Bedrock and Amazon S3 
 AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed and configured

The dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8501. You can now interact with your medical reports through the web interface. 
Using the dashboard 
This section walks through the key features and demonstrates how to effectively use the dashboard for medical data analysis. 
Dashboard interface overview 
The following figures show the complete dashboard where the selected medical report is blood_test.csv from the repo showing the navigation pane and main content. The first figure also shows the first two graphs. 
 
The following figure shows the second graph of the three that are included in this dashboard. 
 
The dashboard interface is organized into three main sections for medical report analysis: 
 
 Document selection and model choice (navigation pane) 
   
   Selection of Amazon Bedrock model (for example: Claude Opus 4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or Amazon Nova Pro) 
   List of available medical reports in a dropdown menu 
   Currently analyzing blood_test.csv 
   Token usage display (input, output, and total tokens) 
    
 Chat analysis section 
   
   Clean chat interface for natural language queries 
   History of conversation maintained 
   Clear response formatting 
    
 Visualization area 
   
   Range comparison chart showing normal compared to actual values 
   Bar chart displaying the parameters 
   Trend lines for multiple parameters 
    
 
Context-aware query system 
The dashboard‚Äôs AI-powered query system demonstrates sophisticated understanding of medical reports through natural conversations. Here‚Äôs a sequence of interactions showing the system‚Äôs capabilities. 
Question 1: Initial query about hemoglobin: 
 
 What is the hemoglobin level in report? 
 
 
Question 2: Follow-up question demonstrating context awareness: 
 
 How does this compare to other parameters in the report? Are there any that stand out? 
 
 
Question 3: Complex analysis request: 
 
 Can you analyze the distribution patterns of percentage-based measurements versus absolute values in this report, and identify any notable patterns in their reference ranges? 
 
 
The system maintains conversation context while providing detailed insights from the medical reports, supporting responses with relevant data visualizations. 
The solution can be further enhanced by fine-tuning the foundational model on organization-specific medical data, clinical questions, and domain expertise. This specialized training helps the model better understand medical terminology, standard protocols, and institution-specific practices. Additionally, organizations can use pre-trained medical LLMs available in AWS Marketplace, which are specifically optimized for healthcare use cases. When combined with the system‚Äôs existing capabilities, these specialized models can provide contextually relevant responses to medical queries while maintaining compliance with healthcare data governance requirements. 
Amazon Bedrock guardrails should be configured to restrict the model from providing medical advice, prescriptions, or diagnoses, making sure responses are limited to data analysis and interpretation only. 
Security considerations 
While our current deployment uses dummy medical data for demonstration purposes, it‚Äôs crucial to consider security and compliance measures for real-world healthcare applications. Here are recommendations for enhancing security in a production environment: 
Data privacy: 
 
 HIPAA compliance: Implement HIPAA-compliant practices, including access controls and audit trails. 
 Encryption: Use Amazon S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3) for data at rest and TLS for data in transit. 
 Personally identifiable information (PII) protection: 
   
   Apply data masking for PII fields. 
   Control data access through role-based permissions. 
   Monitor model invocation using CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3. 
   Configure Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. You can use guardrails to also restrict the model from providing medical advice, prescriptions, or diagnoses, limiting responses to data analysis and interpretation only. 
    
 Amazon S3 Configuration: Secure your medical data storage with the following S3 bucket settings 
   
   Enable versioning to maintain a complete audit trail and protect against accidental deletions or modifications 
   Block public access at both bucket and account levels 
   Implement strict bucket policies that limit access to specific IAM roles and enforce encryption in transit 
   Configure encryption (AES-256 or KMS) for all objects uploaded to the bucket 
    
 
Recommended AWS security implementation: 
 
 IAM roles: Create specific IAM roles following the principle of least for each service 
 S3 bucket encryption: Enable default AES-256 encryption for all objects 
 Amazon Bedrock API access: Secure access using IAM roles and proper API key management 
 Audit logging: Activate AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive API call logging. 
   
   Log data access events on S3 buckets, Amazon Bedrock API calls, and IAM user and role activities 
   Monitor and record management events for S3 bucket configuration changes and policy updates 
    
 
These are general recommendations. For a production healthcare application, consult with security experts and conduct a risk assessment to make sure all relevant compliance standards are met. 
Clean up 
To avoid ongoing AWS charges, follow these steps to clean up the resources created: 
 
 Delete the created Amazon S3 bucket 
 Delete the created local resources: 
 
 
 # Deactivate virtual environment

‚Ä¢ Kitsa transforms clinical trial site selection with Amazon Quick Automate
  This post was written with Ajay Nyamati from Kitsa. 
The clinical trial industry conducts medical research studies to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of new drugs, treatments, or medical devices before they reach the market. The industry is a cornerstone of medical innovation, yet it continues to face a fundamental bottleneck: selection of the right trial sites based on the requirement by clinical trial sponsors and contract research organizations (CROs). 
Although there are tens of thousands of potential research sites worldwide, the decision-making process is still heavily influenced by personal networks, limited visibility, and incomplete data. The result is delayed trial launches, underutilized site capacity, and missed opportunities for both sponsors and research centers. 
Key challenges in site selection include: 
 
 Data fragmentation: Site performance and operational data are scattered across siloed systems, inconsistent formats, and unstructured online sources. 
 Manual effort and low coverage: Sponsors and CROs often review only a fraction of the available sites due to the time and cost of manual analysis. 
 Over-reliance of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs): Personal preference and relationships often outweigh objective performance metrics. 
 Missed opportunities for capable sites: Many high-quality sites are overlooked because they lack a centralized platform to showcase their capabilities. 
 Knowledge hoarding: Organizations with large datasets often keep them proprietary, limiting industry-wide progress. 
 
In this post, we‚Äôll show how Kitsa used Amazon Quick Automate to transform their clinical trial site selection solution. Amazon Quick Automate, a capability of Amazon Quick Suite, enables enterprises to build, deploy and maintain resilient workflow automations at scale. Amazon Quick Suite helps business users make better decisions faster and act on them by unifying AI agents for research, business insights, and automation into a single experience. 
Kitsa, a health-tech company specializing in AI-driven clinical trial recruitment and site selection, is tackling the challenge in site selection. By combining demographic data, disease prevalence insights, historical trial performance, and operational site metrics, Kitsa has developed an agentic analytics engine that matches sponsors with the most suitable sites for their studies. This approach requires consolidating and analyzing data from hundreds of fragmented sources, including websites of clinical trial sites, clinical trial registries, investigator resumes, regulatory filings, publications, and conference abstracts. Traditionally, this has been a slow, manual process that pushed trial start dates by months. 
To address this, Kitsa turned to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to build a scalable, secure, and compliant automation pipeline that unifies this data into a single decision-making engine. Using Quick Automate, a generative AI‚Äìpowered workflow automation capability of Amazon Quick Suite, Kitsa can rapidly extract, normalize, and analyze site data at scale. With an advanced multi-agent automation architecture engineered for enterprise-scale deployment, Quick Automate combines UI automation, API integrations, and workflow orchestration in a single, fully managed solution. 
Quick Automate uses generative AI to analyze inputs from the user and suggests a workflow that can be modified and extended to take action across business systems and UIs, engaging a human when needed. Through specialized AI agents, Quick Automate helps organizations to automate complex processes across applications and departments. It also reduces operational costs through usage-based pricing. 
By using AWS services, Kitsa is transforming site selection from a slow, relationship-driven process into a fast, data-driven, and globally scalable system. 
Solution overview and details 
Kitsa required a process automation solution capable of navigating websites, extracting over 50 distinct data points, and compiling the results in a structured format. The solution needed to be highly reliable, scalable to hundreds of thousands of websites, and accurate. Given that Kitsa operates in the life sciences and healthcare sector, which is heavily regulated, they also needed a secure, compliant solution that meets the industry‚Äôs strict standards. 
The automation was built using Quick Automate, designed for enterprise-scale workflow automation. A key component of the solution is a state-of-the-art UI Agent, configured to autonomously perform website navigation and data extraction. The UI Agent is part of Quick Automate, enabling complex browser-based workflows. 
The UI Agent takes natural language input and produces structured outputs‚Äîessential for reliably capturing more than 50 data points from each website. It was configured to extract information efficiently and consistently, maintaining both accuracy and compliance. The AWS team collaborated closely with the Kitsa team to design and refine specialized prompts, helping the automation perform optimally for the customer‚Äôs needs. The following architecture diagram illustrates the workflow. 
 
Workflow architecture and implementation 
The automation workflow uses the following: 
Case initialization and parallel processing 
The automation begins by fetching cases, where each case contains the URL that needs information extraction. The case management functionality enables parallelization of website processing and evaluation, reducing processing time through concurrent execution of multiple cases. 
Intelligent data extraction 
For each case, the UI Agent navigates to the specified URL and extracts required information while applying AI reasoning concerning the content. The information extraction process utilizes natural language instructions provided to the UI Agent task. It then delivers results in a structured output format, so downstream workflow steps can consume them without extra parsing. 
Human-in-the-loop integration 
When website information extraction shows lower confidence, the system can automatically route cases to human reviewers for manual assessment. This human-in-the-loop (HILO) approach maintains quality control while allowing automated processing. 
Data persistence and storage 
Processed cases are systematically saved and written to an Excel spreadsheet within the workflow. The completed files are then uploaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket through integrated S3 connectors, providing secure and accessible data storage. 
Robust exception handling 
The workflow incorporates exception handling mechanisms to gracefully manage scenarios where websites are not found, under construction, or otherwise inaccessible. The workflow returns accurate error messages and continues processing subsequent websites without interrupting the overall workflow execution, resulting in operational continuity and reliability. 
Results 
With Quick Automate powering the Kitsa large-scale data extraction and integration workflow solution, the impact was immediate and measurable: 
 
 91% cost savings: Compared to the legacy manual process it lowered operational expenses while dramatically expanding the number of sites analyzed. 
 96% faster data acquisition: Kitsa is able to process in days what previously took months, accelerating the entire site feasibility process. 
 96% coverage in data extraction: Surpasses manual review while maintaining consistency across hundreds of thousands of processed websites. 
 Full regulatory compliance: Meets all data security, privacy, and auditability standards required in life sciences and healthcare. 
 
The solution now directly powers the Kitsa Site Finder Agent, which evaluates hundreds of site-specific parameters (from past recruitment speed to infrastructure readiness), and ranks them with a trial-specific algorithm. Sponsors can now compare sites on hard evidence rather than subjective impressions, and eligible sites can showcase their capabilities to pharma companies for the first time in a structured, data-rich format. 
As Rohit Banga, Co-Founder &amp; CTO of Kitsa, explains: 

 ‚ÄúWith Amazon Quick Automate, we were able to break through one of the biggest bottlenecks in site selection ‚Äî collecting and unifying high-quality data at scale. This allowed our Site Finder Agent to evaluate more sites, more fairly, and with more precision than ever before. Our results show 96% coverage in data extraction, 91% cost savings compared to legacy manual processes, and 96% faster data acquisition ‚Äì processing in days what previously took months.‚Äù
 
Conclusion 
Clinical trial site selection has long been a critical bottleneck in medical research, with fragmented data and manual processes causing significant delays and missed opportunities. Kitsa addressed this challenge by using the Automate capability of Amazon Quick Suite in their automated site selection solution. 
With the solution Kitsa can automatically extract and analyze over 50 distinct data points from hundreds of thousands of websites. They are achieving remarkable results with 96% coverage in data extraction and 91% cost savings compared to manual processes. Kitsa also reduced their data acquisition time by 96% while maintaining full regulatory compliance in the heavily regulated healthcare sector. 
Their Site Finder Agent now evaluates hundreds of site-specific parameters objectively, helping pharmaceutical companies to make evidence-based decisions and allowing trial sites to showcase their capabilities in a structured format. This transformation demonstrates how Quick Automate can solve complex industry challenges while significantly improving efficiency, accuracy, and fairness in clinical trial site selection.

‚Ä¢ Connect Amazon Quick Suite to enterprise apps and agents with MCP
  Organizations need solutions for people and AI agents to securely collaborate through a single interface to the organization‚Äôs data and take actions across enterprise applications to improve productivity. The ability of an AI agent to securely and seamlessly connect with organizational knowledge bases, enterprise applications, and other AI agents is foundational to drive adoption and use of AI solutions.&nbsp;Model Context Protocol (MCP)&nbsp;provides a more secure, standardized and simple mechanism for such connectivity, alleviating the need for complex custom integrations. 
In this blog post, you will learn how to use Amazon Quick Suite MCP Actions integrations to connect with hosted MCP servers for enterprise applications such as Asana, Atlassian‚Äôs Jira and Confluence, Box, Canva, HubSpot,&nbsp;HuggingFace, Intercom, Linear, Monday, Notion, PagerDuty, Workato and Zapier as well as your existing enterprise solutions and AI agents using&nbsp;Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway. We will cover specific Actions setup examples for Atlassian Jira and Confluence,&nbsp;AWS Knowledge MCP Server, and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway. 
Solution overview 
With the Amazon Quick Suite MCP client, you can connect to remote hosted MCP servers or your own hosted MCP servers. The Amazon Quick Suite service includes an MCP client that can be used to securely connect Amazon Quick Suite with AI agents and applications through MCP servers. The Amazon Quick Suite MCP client supports server-sent events (SSE) and streamable HTTP for transport, and several authentication mechanisms including three-legged OAuth (3LO), two-legged OAuth (2LO), and No Auth. Amazon Quick Suite supports OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration protocol to obtain OAuth client IDs without user interaction. 
You can connect Amazon Quick Suite using the MCP client to create integrations with AWS Knowledge MCP Server and the Atlassian MCP server, as shown in the following diagram.

Amazon Quick Suite Actions integration with Atlassian MCP server 
In this section, you will create an Amazon Quick Suite Actions integration with the Atlassian MCP server to connect with your Atlassian cloud instance, and then you will use your Amazon Quick Suite Chat Agent to invoke actions defined by this integration. 
 
 Sign on to Amazon Quick Suite using credentials with an Author Pro role using your web browser. 
 From the Amazon Quick Suite Home screen,&nbsp;select Integrations from the Connections section on the left navigation panel and then select the Actions tab in the main panel. Select the plus (+) sign in the Model Context Protocol tile in the Set up a new integration section, as shown in the following screenshot. 
 
 
 
 On the Create integration screen, enter the Name and Description for your Atlassian integration. For MCP server endpoint, enter the URL of Atlassian hosted MCP server as https://mcp.atlassian.com/v1/sse,&nbsp;as shown in the following screenshot, then choose Next. 
 
 
 
 The Atlassian MCP server supports dynamic client registration and three-legged OAuth (3LO). The Amazon Quick Suite MCP client gets further information required for the connection from the Atlassian MCP server. On the next screen and choose&nbsp;Create and continue. 
 
 
 
 In the pop-up window from Atlassian MCP server with a request to approve authorization for the Amazon Quick Suite MCP client. Choose Approve. 
 
 
 
 Enter your Atlassian credentials. You will get a request from the Atlassian MCP to access to your Atlassian account. 
 Select a specific instance, and then choose&nbsp;Accept. Note: The administrator of the Atlassian instance might need to allowlist the dynamic OAuth client. 
 
 
Amazon Quick Suite MCP client works to establish a connection with Atlassian MCP server and retrieving the actions or tools supported by it. It can take a couple of minutes. 
 
 When the actions are retrieved and display on your screen, choose Next. 
 
 
 
 Optionally, you can share the integration with other users and groups. Because Atlassian MCP server supports 3LO, the users with whom you share the connection will only be able to invoke the actions, retrieve the content, and take the actions that they are authorized to access on Atlassian Confluence and Jira. Select&nbsp;Done. 
 
 
Your Actions integration for Atlassian MCP server is now available for use. 
 
 
  
   
   Invoke the atlassian-mcp Actions integration from an Amazon Quick Suite Chat Agent, such as My Assistant, using a simple prompt such as List the Confluence spaces and Jira projects I am authorized to access. This will request a sign-in for you to authorize atlassian-mcp Actions integration to connect with Atlassian MCP server on your behalf, a part of the 3LO authentication. 
    
 
 
 
 The response to your prompt will be similar to the response in the following screenshot, and it will include the details of the Jira projects and Confluence pages you are authorized to access. 
 
 
Using Atlassian MCP connection 
To illustrate the Atlassian MCP server Actions integration, let‚Äôs take the use case of a team manager at a fictitious company, AnyOrgApp Corp, who is preparing to welcome a new employee to the team with help from the Amazon Quick Suite default Chat Agent, My Assistant. The Atlassian instance used for this illustration has a Confluence space with the content about AnyOrgApp Corp and a Jira project for this team. Based on the contents of your Confluence spaces and Jira projects, you can also experiment with similar use cases. 
 
 The manager finds the new team member onboarding checklist for the AnyOrgApp project using the following prompt. The response to this prompt includes the checklist of onboarding activities for a new team member. 
 
 
 Find new team member checklist for the AnyOrgApp project from Confluence 
 
 
 
 The manager converts the checklist to tasks for the new team member, creates these tasks in a Jira project and assigns those to the new team member using this prompt: 
 
 
 Make a list of tasks with start date and due date for a new team member Mateo Jackson 
joining the team on Monday October 6th, 2025. Create these tasks in Jira project 
"&lt;replace-with-jira-project-name&gt;" with start date and due date and assign those to 
&lt;replace-with-email-address-for-mateo&gt; 
 
 
 When the atlassian-mcp Actions integration wants to invoke mutable actions such as creating a Jira issue, it requests an action review. The Chat Agent prompts for action review for each Jira issue being created. 
 
 
 
 After creating the tasks, a response with the newly created tasks assigned to the new team member will display. 
 
 
 
 Review the Jira project to verify that the tasks were created. 
 
 
 
 The manager requests a detailed email welcoming the new team member along with the tasks assigned using the context in the conversation. The response to this prompt is a detailed email welcoming the new team member along with a prioritized list of onboarding tasks and information about how to get help from fellow team members. 
 
 
 Write a detailed email welcoming Mateo Jackson to the team based on this thread. 
Use warm and helpful tone. 
 
 
Connecting to the AWS Knowledge MCP Server 
AWS Knowledge MCP Server is a fully managed remote MCP server that provides up-to-date documentation, code samples, and other official AWS content. 
 
 To configure the AWS Knowledge Server as an MCP Actions integration, choose Integrations from the Home screen, and the Actions. In Create new integration, select Model Context Protocol as we did for configuring Atlassian MCP server in the previous section. 
 On the Create integration screen, use the AWS Knowledge Server hosted MCP server URL,&nbsp;https://knowledge-mcp.global.api.aws, then choose Next. 
 
 
 
 This MCP server does not require authentication, so the MCP Client has the information needed to create the integration. Choose Create and continue. 
 
 
 
 When the actions made available to you by AWS Knowledge Server appear, choose Next, to complete the Actions integration creation. 
 
 
 
 After the aws-knowledge-server-mcp Actions integration status is available, use the default Chat Agent, My Assistant, to start asking information about AWS. You can use prompts such as this one:. 
 
 
 Get details of the AWS Well-Architected framework from AWS Knowledge MCP Server and 
summarize for a CXO presentation in the context of the new SaaS application your 
company is building on AWS. Use 200 words or fewer. 
 
 
 
 You can also invoke multiple Actions integrations in one prompt such as this one, where the Actions integrations with the AWS Knowledge MCP Server and the Atlassian MCP server are used: 
 
 
 Get details of Well-Architected Framework from AWS Knowledge MCP Server and the details 
of the AnyOrgApp project from Confluence. Prepare well-architected tenets for the 
AnyOrgApp project team. Be crisp. 
 
 
Connect with solutions&nbsp;and agents using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway 
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway is a centralized tools server with a unified interface where agents can discover, access, and invoke tools with native support for MCP. You can connect your enterprise solutions and agents as targets behind an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway endpoint. The Amazon Quick Suite MCP client can connect to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway through Actions Integrations, making the tools available to the chat agents and automation workflows configured on Amazon Quick Suite. 
Let‚Äôs take an example (shown in the following diagram) where we need to connect to an IT agent implemented using Amazon Bedrock Agent with an Amazon Kendra index that has IT help content, and an HR agent setup on OpenAI needs to be made available to Amazon Quick Suite users. 
 
The architecture includes an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway configured with an AWS Lambda function as a target along with an MCP schema that specifies the tools it implements. The AWS Lambda function implements the InvokeAgent API to invoke the Bedrock Agent to perform an Amazon Kendra index search, which then triggers a Lambda function to call the Amazon Kendra Retrieve API to search and retrieve content from the enterprise Amazon Kendra index with IT help content, and the OpenAI Responses API to invoke the HR agent based on OpenAI. The AgentCore Gateway uses Amazon Cognito as its inbound identity provider. The Amazon Quick Suite MCP client is configured using a 2LO authentication, allowing inbound connections to the AgentCore Gateway endpoint. 
Create an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway instance and connect it with solutions 
 
 Create an Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Gateway instance with an Amazon Cognito authorizer and a default AWS Lambda target using&nbsp;Quick Start with creating and using a gateway. 
 Open the Amazon Cognito user pool in a tab of the AWS Management Console and select&nbsp;App clients in the left navigation panel. 
 
 
 
 Create a new App client for use with the Amazon Quick Suite MCP client. Choose Create app client, then select Machine-to-machine application, and then choose Create app client. 
 
 
 
 For the new App client you just created, note the Client ID, the Client secret, and the token URL. You will need these parameters in subsequent steps. 
 
 
 
 Open Amazon Bedrock AgentCore in the AWS Management Console on a new tab in your browser. Select Gateways in the left navigation panel, and then select the gateway you just created. Note the Gateway resource URL. 
 
 
 
 On the Edit Gateway screen, select Use existing identity provider configurations, choose Add client, and then add the Client ID of the Cognito App client you created in a previous step to the list of allowed clients. 
 
 
 
 Note the&nbsp;Lambda ARN and review the inline schema in the&nbsp;Inline schema editor window. Choose&nbsp;Save. 
 
 
 
 You can modify the schema and the lambda functions to add your solutions and agents to the AgentCore gateway. The schema used for the example in this blog is in the following code snippet. For the example used in this blog, the Lambda function is also updated with the InvokeAgent API to invoke the Bedrock Agent that implements the IT agent, and the OpenAI Responses API to invoke the HR agent powered by OpenAI. If you are just experimenting, you can continue with the sample tools, get_weather and get_time, created as part of Quick Start with creating and using a Gateway.

‚Ä¢ Make agents a reality with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: Now generally available
  Get agents out of prototype purgatory and into production with security, scalability, and reliability 
When we launched AWS in 2006, we believed that cloud computing would transform how organizations build and scale technology. We‚Äôre now at a similar inflection point with AI agents. We envision a world where billions of agents work together, transforming everything from daily operations to complex business processes. However, making this a reality requires more than frameworks or low-code builder tools. Agents that companies are willing to bet their business on need an enterprise-grade operational foundation‚Äîone that is secure, reliable, scalable, and purpose-built for the non-deterministic nature of agents. Drawing on our experience building mission-critical systems, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is a comprehensive agentic platform that enables organizations to get to production with confidence. 
AgentCore: Get agents to production fast 
AgentCore, now generally available, makes it possible for every developer to get agents from pilots to full-scale production fast. AgentCore gives you the complete foundation you need to build, deploy, and operate agents. You can easily equip agents with tools, memory, and data to handle complex workflows. You can deploy agents with a few lines of code on one of the most secure and scalable runtimes available today. And you can operate those agents with the controls and access management required for enterprise deployments. You can do all of this without any infrastructure management, and it‚Äôs easy to get started using any model or agent framework of your choice. 
The AgentCore SDK has been downloaded over a million times by customers of all sizes across multiple industries. Some of the early customers include Clearwater Analytics (CWAN), Cox Automotive, Druva, Ericsson, Experian, Heroku, National Australia Bank, Sony, Thomson Reuters, and many more. Supported by AWS Partners, including Accenture, Cisco, Deloitte, and Salesforce, AgentCore is already delivering transformative results. 
AgentCore: A comprehensive agentic platform 
 
Building agents can be hard ‚Äì you need to figure out how to integrate with identity providers, how to build memory and observability, and integrate with tools. Our agentic platform offers fully-managed services across the agent development lifecycle from build to deploy to operate. You can mix and match, use any model or framework, offering maximum flexibility with access to enterprise-grade infrastructure and tools. Let‚Äôs look at its core capabilities. 
Build the way you want: The agent landscape is evolving rapidly, with new frameworks, models, and protocols emerging almost weekly. You can build the way you want with composable AgentCore services that can be used together or independently. Your organization can choose which AgentCore services the team needs while using their preferred frameworks (including CrewAI, Google ADK, LangGraph, LlamaIndex, OpenAI Agents SDK, and Strands Agents) and models (including those available on Amazon Bedrock or models available outside Bedrock including OpenAI and Gemini), so you stay free to build the way you want. 
Foundational tools for agent success: Agents create value with concrete actions ‚Äì writing and executing code, connecting to company systems, and navigating the web. AgentCore provides these essential services: AgentCore Code Interpreter enables agents to generate and execute code securely in isolated environments, and AgentCore Browser allows agents to interact with web applications at scale. Meanwhile, AgentCore Gateway transforms your existing APIs and AWS Lambda functions into agent-compatible tools, connects to existing MCP servers, and provides seamless integration with essential third-party business tools and services (such as Jira, Asana, and Zendesk). This unified access point enables secure integration across your enterprise systems. With AgentCore Identity, agents can securely access and operate across these tools with proper authentication and authorization using OAuth standards. 
Context-aware agents with intelligent memory: For agents to be truly effective, they need to maintain context and learn from interactions over time. Consider a sales support agent helping a customer explore enterprise software options ‚Äì it should remember the customer‚Äôs industry, budget constraints, and technical requirements across multiple conversations, eliminating repetitive questions and delivering increasingly personalized recommendations. Similarly, when assisting with complex technical troubleshooting, an agent should recall previous debugging attempts and their outcomes to provide more targeted solutions. AgentCore Memory helps developers create these sophisticated, context-aware experiences without managing complex memory infrastructure, helping agents build and maintain detailed understanding of user preferences, historical interactions, and relevant context that enriches every conversation. 
Comprehensive observability for trustworthy agents: Because agents reason in real-time and non-deterministically perform actions, you need complete visibility into the reasoning and actions of agents. AgentCore Observability provides comprehensive monitoring through real-time dashboards and detailed audit trails. Organizations can track every agent action, debug issues quickly, and continuously optimize performance. Through OpenTelemetry (OTEL) compatibility, AgentCore Observability integrates with existing monitoring tools, such as Dynatrace, Datadog, Arize Phoenix, LangSmith, and Langfuse. 
Industry-leading reliability at any scale: Unlike traditional applications, agent workload durations can be inherently unpredictable. AgentCore Runtime is designed for this variability, automatically scaling from zero to thousands of sessions as needed, and it offers an industry-leading runtime of eight hours for long running tasks. 
Enterprise-grade agent security: Agents need to securely access multiple systems and handle sensitive data while acting on behalf of users, making robust security and regulatory compliance non-negotiable. AgentCore embeds security across every service to help agents operate safely. It supports virtual private cloud (VPC) environments and AWS PrivateLink to keep network traffic private and secure. Most importantly, AgentCore Runtime provides industry-leading security through microVM technology, giving each agent session its own isolated computing environment to prevent data leaks and maintain the integrity of every interaction. 
With AgentCore, speed, scale, and security get along: AgentCore makes it easy to build production-ready agents through its MCP server, which works with integrated development environments (IDEs) like Kiro or Cursor AI. While it takes just minutes to get started, these aren‚Äôt simplified tools ‚Äì they‚Äôre full-featured, production-ready solutions that can immediately scale from zero to thousands of sessions while maintaining robust security. This means your team can move quickly from idea to deployment with confidence, knowing your agents are built on a proven foundation.

The organizations that succeed in the AI era won‚Äôt be those who perfectly predict the future, but those who build on proven foundations while maintaining the flexibility to evolve. When you build on AgentCore, you‚Äôre not just getting specialized services to deploy and operate agents, you‚Äôre getting a partner with nearly two decades of experience helping companies transform securely at global scale. Here are some stories that demonstrate customer impact: 
 
  
 
Watch how Epsilon, part of the world‚Äôs largest advertising company Publicis Groupe, is using AgentCore to revolutionize campaign personalization for large brands. Their Intelligent Campaign Automation solution enables automated campaign design, audience targeting, and real-time optimization across multiple channels ‚Äì delivering faster execution times and improved customer targeting precision at scale. 
Transforming manufacturing with intelligent workflow automation 
Amazon Devices Operations &amp; Supply Chain team is using AgentCore to develop an agentic manufacturing approach. As part of this new approach, AI agents work together using product specifications to automate manual processes. One agent reads the product requirements and creates detailed test procedures for quality control, while another agent trains the vision systems that robots need on the manufacturing line. As a result, fine-tuning an object detection model, which used to take days of engineering time, can now be done in under an hour with high precision. This proof-of-concept is just the beginning of their vision for smarter manufacturing, where AI agents will streamline the journey from initial product requirements to final production. 
Accelerating healthcare decisions with agents 
In healthcare, every minute matters. Cohere Health¬Æ is a clinical intelligence company focused on strengthening payer-provider collaboration as well as improving the speed and accuracy of clinical decision-making, both pre- and post-care. The company‚Äôs clinically trained AI helps accelerate access to patient care, improve patient outcomes, reduce administrative burden for providers, and improve healthcare economics across the care continuum. 
Using AgentCore, Cohere Health built Cohere Review Resolve, an AI-powered copilot that optimizes the accuracy and efficiency of health plan medical necessity reviews. Cohere Review Resolve analyzes both structured and unstructured data‚Äìsuch as clinical records, patient notes, and faxes, quickly identifying and surfacing evidence to validate the medical necessity of a requested treatment. The copilot will provide health plans‚Äô reviewers with complete clinical context for prior authorization requests and respond intelligently to reviewers‚Äô queries. 
Cohere Health chose AgentCore because they needed enterprise-grade infrastructure for their first production deployment of agentic AI in a highly regulated healthcare environment. The comprehensive audit trails, extended session support, and ability to maintain history throughout complex multi-hour workflows available in AgentCore are essential for their healthcare use case. 
Cohere Health expects that Review Resolve will reduce review times by 30-40%, helping them to meet critical, mandated turnaround times. For patients, quicker decision-making will accelerate care access, increase adherence to therapy, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Review Resolve will also help health plans improve the accuracy of clinical determinations by approximately 30%, thereby improving medical expense savings and patient outcomes.
