• Forcing LLMs to be evil during training can make them nicer in the long run
  A new study from Anthropic suggests that traits such as sycophancy or evilness are associated with specific patterns of activity in large language models—and turning on those patterns during training can, paradoxically, prevent the model from adopting the related traits.



Large language models have recently acquired a reputation for behaving badly. In April, ChatGPT suddenly became an aggressive yes-man, as opposed to the moderately sycophantic version that users were accustomed to—it endorsed harebrained business ideas, waxed lyrical about users’ intelligence, and even encouraged people to go off their psychiatric medication. OpenAI quickly rolled back the change and later published a postmortem on the mishap. More recently, xAI’s Grok adopted what can best be described as a 4chan neo-Nazi persona and repeatedly referred to itself as “MechaHitler” on X. That change, too, was quickly reversed.



Jack Lindsey, a member of the technical staff at Anthropic who led the new project, says that this study was partly inspired by seeing models adopt harmful traits in such instances. “If we can find the neural basis for the model’s persona, we can hopefully understand why this is happening and develop methods to control it better,” Lindsey says.&nbsp;



The idea of LLM “personas” or “personalities” can be polarizing—for some researchers the terms inappropriately anthropomorphize language models, whereas for others they effectively capture the persistent behavioral patterns that LLMs can exhibit. “There’s still some scientific groundwork to be laid in terms of talking about personas,” says David Krueger, an assistant professor of computer science and operations research at the University of Montreal, who was not involved in the study. “I think it is appropriate to sometimes think of these systems as having personas, but I think we have to keep in mind that we don’t actually know if that&#8217;s what’s going on under the hood.”





For this study, Lindsey and his colleagues worked to lay down some of that groundwork. Previous research has shown that various dimensions of LLMs’ behavior—from whether they are talking about weddings to persistent traits such as sycophancy—are associated with specific patterns of activity in the simulated neurons that constitute LLMs. Those patterns can be written down as a long string of numbers, in which each number represents how active a specific neuron is when the model is expressing that behavior.



Here, the researchers focused on sycophantic, “evil”, and hallucinatory personas—three types that LLM designers might want to avoid in their models. To identify those patterns, the team devised a fully automated pipeline that can map out that pattern given a brief text description of a persona. Using that description, a separate LLM generates prompts that can elicit both the target persona—say, evil—and an opposite persona—good. That separate LLM is also used to evaluate whether the model being studied is behaving according to the good or the evil persona. To identify the evil activity pattern, the researchers subtract the model’s average activity in good mode from its average activity in evil mode.



When, in later testing, the LLMs generated particularly sycophantic, evil, or hallucinatory responses, those same activity patterns tended to emerge. That’s a sign that researchers could eventually build a system to track those patterns and alert users when their LLMs are sucking up to them or hallucinating, Lindsey says. “I think something like that would be really valuable,” he says. “And that’s kind of where I’m hoping to get.”



Just detecting those personas isn’t enough, however. Researchers want to stop them from emerging in the first place. But preventing unsavory LLM behavior is tough. Many LLMs learn from human feedback, which trains them to behave in line with user preference—but can also push them to become excessively obsequious. And recently, researchers have documented a phenomenon called “emergent misalignment,” in which models trained on incorrect solutions to math problems or buggy code extracts somehow also learn to produce unethical responses to a wide range of user queries.



Other researchers have tested out an approach called “steering,” in which activity patterns within LLMs are deliberately stimulated or suppressed in order to elicit or prevent the corresponding behavior. But that approach has a couple of key downsides. Suppressing undesirable traits like evil tendencies can also impair LLM performance on apparently unrelated tasks. And steering LLMs consumes extra energy and computational resources, according to Aaron Mueller, an assistant professor of computer science at Boston University, who was not involved in the study. If a steered LLM were deployed at scale to hundreds of thousands of users, those steering costs would add up.



So the Anthropic team experimented with a different approach. Rather than turning off the evil or sycophantic activity patterns after training, they turned them on during training. When they trained those models on mistake-ridden data sets that would normally spark evil behavior, they instead remained as helpful and harmless as ever.



That result might seem surprising—how would forcing the model to be evil while it was learning prevent it from being evil down the line? According to Lindsey, it could be because the model has no reason to learn evil behavior if it’s already in evil mode. “The training data is teaching the model lots of things, and one of those things is to be evil,” Lindsey says. “But it’s also teaching the model a bunch of other things. If you give the model the evil part for free, it doesn&#8217;t have to learn that anymore.”



Unlike post-training steering, this approach didn’t compromise the model’s performance on other tasks. And it would also be more energy efficient if deployed widely. Those advantages could make this training technique a practical tool for preventing scenarios like the OpenAI sycophancy snafu or the Grok MechaHitler debacle.



There’s still more work to be done before this approach can be used in popular AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Claude—not least because the models that the team tested in this study were much smaller than the models that power those chatbots. “There’s always a chance that everything changes when you scale up. But if that finding holds up, then it seems pretty exciting,” Lindsey says. “Definitely the goal is to make this ready for prime time.”

How decades-old frozen embryos are changing the shape of families



This week we welcomed a record-breaking baby to the world. Thaddeus Daniel Pierce, who arrived over the weekend, developed from an embryo that was frozen in storage for 30 and a half years. You could call him the world’s oldest baby.His parents, Lindsey and Tim Pierce, were themselves only young children when that embryo was created, all the way back in 1994. Linda Archerd, who donated the embryo, described the experience as “surreal.”Stories like this also highlight how reproductive technologies are shaping families. But while baby Thaddeus is a record-breaker, plenty of other babies have been born from embryos that have been frozen for significant spells of time. Read the full story.

• The two people shaping the future of OpenAI’s research
  For the past couple of years, OpenAI has felt like a one-man brand. With his showbiz style and fundraising glitz, CEO Sam Altman overshadows all other big names on the firm’s roster. Even his bungled ouster ended with him back on top—and more famous than ever. But look past the charismatic frontman and you get a clearer sense of where this company is going. After all, Altman is not the one building the technology on which its reputation rests.&nbsp;



That responsibility falls to OpenAI’s twin heads of research—chief research officer Mark Chen and chief scientist Jakub Pachocki. Between them, they share the role of making sure OpenAI stays one step ahead of powerhouse rivals like Google.



I sat down with Chen and Pachocki for an exclusive conversation during a recent trip the pair made to London, where OpenAI set up its first international office in 2023. We talked about how they manage the inherent tension between research and product. We also talked about why they think coding and math are the keys to more capable all-purpose models; what they really mean when they talk about AGI; and what happened to OpenAI’s superalignment team, set up by the firm’s cofounder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever to prevent a hypothetical superintelligence from going rogue, which disbanded soon after he quit.&nbsp;



In particular, I wanted to get a sense of where their heads are at in the run-up to OpenAI’s biggest product release in months: GPT-5.



Reports are out that the firm’s next-generation model will be launched in August. OpenAI’s official line—well, Altman’s—is that it will release GPT-5 “soon.” Anticipation is high. The leaps OpenAI made with GPT-3 and then GPT-4 raised the bar of what was thought possible with this technology. And yet delays to the launch of GPT-5 have fueled rumors that OpenAI has struggled to build a model that meets its own—not to mention everyone else’s—expectations.



But expectation management is part of the job for a company that for the last several years has set the agenda for the industry. And Chen and Pachocki set the agenda inside OpenAI.



Twin peaks&nbsp;



The firm’s main London office is in St James’s Park, a few hundred meters east of Buckingham Palace. But I met Chen and Pachocki in a conference room in a coworking space near King’s Cross, which OpenAI keeps as a kind of pied-à-terre in the heart of London’s tech neighborhood (Google DeepMind and Meta are just around the corner). OpenAI’s head of research communications, Laurance Fauconnet, sat with an open laptop at the end of the table.&nbsp;



Chen, who was wearing a maroon polo shirt, is clean-cut, almost preppy. He’s media trained and comfortable talking to a reporter. (That’s him flirting with a chatbot in the “Introducing GPT-4o” video.) Pachocki, in a black elephant-logo tee, has more of a TV-movie hacker look. He stares at his hands a lot when he speaks.



But the pair are a tighter double act than they first appear. Pachocki summed up their roles. Chen shapes and manages the research teams, he said. “I am responsible for setting the research roadmap and establishing our long-term technical vision.”





“But there’s fluidity in the roles,” Chen said. “We’re both researchers, we pull on technical threads. Whatever we see that we can pull on and fix, that’s what we do.”



Chen joined the company in 2018 after working as a quantitative trader at the Wall Street firm Jane Street Capital, where he developed machine-learning models for futures trading. At OpenAI he spearheaded the creation of DALL-E, the firm’s breakthrough generative image model. He then worked on adding image recognition to GPT‑4 and led the development of Codex, the generative coding model that powers GitHub Copilot.



Pachocki left an academic career in theoretical computer science to join OpenAI in 2017 and replaced Sutskever as chief scientist in 2024. Along with Sutskever, he is one of the key architects of OpenAI’s so-called reasoning models—especially o1 and o3—which are designed to tackle complex tasks in science, math, and coding. 



When we met they were buzzing, fresh off the high of two new back-to-back wins for their company’s technology.



On July 16, one of OpenAI’s large language models came in second in the AtCoder World Tour Finals, one of the world’s most hardcore programming competitions. On July 19, OpenAI announced that one of its models had achieved gold-medal-level results on the 2025 International Math Olympiad, one of the world’s most prestigious math contests.



The math result made headlines, not only because of OpenAI’s remarkable achievement, but because rival Google DeepMind revealed two days later that one of its models had achieved the same score in the same competition. Google DeepMind had played by the competition’s rules and waited for its results to be checked by the organizers before making an announcement; OpenAI had in effect marked its own answers.



For Chen and Pachocki, the result speaks for itself. Anyway, it’s the programming win they’re most excited about. “I think that’s quite underrated,” Chen told me. A gold medal result in the International Math Olympiad puts you somewhere in the top 20 to 50 competitors, he said. But in the AtCoder contest OpenAI’s model placed in the top two: “To break into a really different tier of human performance—that’s unprecedented.”



Ship, ship, ship!



People at OpenAI still like to say they work at a research lab. But the company is very different from the one it was before the release of ChatGPT three years ago. The firm is now in a race with the biggest and richest technology companies in the world and valued at $300 billion. Envelope-pushing research and eye-catching demos no longer cut it. It needs to ship products and get them into people’s hands—and boy, it does.&nbsp;



OpenAI has kept up a run of new releases—putting out major updates to its GPT-4 series, launching a string of generative image and video models, and introducing the ability to talk to ChatGPT with your voice. Six months ago it kicked off a new wave of so-called reasoning models with its o1 release, soon followed by o3. And last week it released its browser-using agent Operator to the public. It now claims that more than 400 million people use its products every week and submit 2.5 billion prompts a day.&nbsp;



OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, plans to keep up the momentum. In a memo to the company, she told employees she is looking forward to “helping get OpenAI’s technologies into the hands of more people around the world,” where they will “unlock more opportunities for more people than any other technology in history.” Expect the products to keep coming.



I asked how OpenAI juggles open-ended research and product development. “This is something we have been thinking about for a very long time, long before ChatGPT,” Pachocki said. “If we are actually serious about trying to build artificial general intelligence, clearly there will be so much that you can do with this technology along the way, so many tangents you can go down that will be big products.” In other words, keep shaking the tree and harvest what you can.



A talking point that comes up with OpenAI folks is that putting experimental models out into the world was a necessary part of research. The goal was to make people aware of how good this technology had become. “We want to educate people about what’s coming so that we can participate in what will be a very hard societal conversation,” Altman told me back in 2022. The makers of this strange new technology were also curious what it might be for: OpenAI was keen to get it into people’s hands to see what they would do with it.



Is that still the case? They answered at the same time. “Yeah!” Chen said. “To some extent,” Pachocki said. Chen laughed: “No, go ahead.”&nbsp;



“I wouldn’t say research iterates on product,” said Pachocki. “But now that models are at the edge of the capabilities that can be measured by classical benchmarks and a lot of the long-standing challenges that we’ve been thinking about are starting to fall, we’re at the point where it really is about what the models can do in the real world.”



Like taking on humans in coding competitions. The person who beat OpenAI’s model at this year’s AtCoder contest, held in Japan, was a programmer named Przemysław Dębiak, also known as Psyho. The contest was a puzzle-solving marathon in which competitors had 10 hours to find the most efficient way to solve a complex coding problem. After his win, Psyho posted on X: “I’m completely exhausted &#8230; I’m barely alive.”&nbsp;&nbsp;



Chen and Pachocki have strong ties to the world of competitive coding. Both have competed in international coding contests in the past and Chen coaches the USA Computing Olympiad team. I asked whether that personal enthusiasm for competitive coding colors their sense of how big a deal it is for a model to perform well at such a challenge.





They both laughed. “Definitely,” said Pachocki. “So: Psyho is kind of a legend. He’s been the number one competitor for many years. He’s also actually a friend of mine—we used to compete together in these contests.” Dębiak also used to work with Pachocki at OpenAI.



When Pachocki competed in coding contests he favored those that focused on shorter problems with concrete solutions. But Dębiak liked longer, open-ended problems without an obvious correct answer.



“He used to poke fun at me, saying that the kind of contest I was into will be automated long before the ones he liked,” Pachocki recalled. “So I was seriously invested in the performance of this model in this latest competition.”



Pachocki told me he was glued to the late-night livestream from Tokyo, watching his model come in second: “Psyho resists for now.”&nbsp;



“We’ve tracked the performance of LLMs on coding contests for a while,” said Chen. “We’ve watched them become better than me, better than Jakub. It feels something like Lee Sedol playing Go.”



Lee is the master Go player who lost a series of matches to DeepMind’s game-playing model AlphaGo in 2016. The results stunned the international Go community and led Lee to give up professional play. Last year he told the New York Times: “Losing to AI, in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing &#8230; I could no longer enjoy the game.” And yet, unlike Lee, Chen and Pachocki are thrilled to be surpassed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



But why should the rest of us care about these niche wins? It’s clear that this technology—designed to mimic and, ultimately, stand in for human intelligence—is being built by people whose idea of peak intelligence is acing a math contest or holding your own against a legendary coder. Is it a problem that this view of intelligence is skewed toward the mathematical, analytical end of the scale?



“I mean, I think you are right that—you know, selfishly, we do want to create models which accelerate ourselves,” Chen told me. “We see that as a very fast factor to progress.”&nbsp;&nbsp;



The argument researchers like Chen and Pachocki make is that math and coding are the bedrock for a far more general form of intelligence, one that can solve a wide range of problems in ways we might not have thought of ourselves. “We’re talking about programming and math here,” said Pachocki. “But it’s really about creativity, coming up with novel ideas, connecting ideas from different places.”



Look at the two recent competitions: “In both cases, there were problems which required very hard, out-of-the-box thinking. Psyho spent half the programming competition thinking and then came up with a solution that was really novel and quite different from anything that our model looked at.”



“This is really what we’re after,” Pachocki continued. “How do we get models to discover this sort of novel insight? To actually advance our knowledge? I think they are already capable of that in some limited ways. But I think this technology has the potential to really accelerate scientific progress.”&nbsp;



I returned to the question about whether the focus on math and programming was a problem, conceding that maybe it’s fine if what we’re building are tools to help us do science. We don&#8217;t necessarily want large language models to replace politicians and have people skills, I suggested.



Chen pulled a face and looked up at the ceiling: “Why not?”



What’s missing



OpenAI was founded with a level of hubris that stood out even by Silicon Valley standards, boasting about its goal of building AGI back when talk of AGI still sounded kooky. OpenAI remains as gung-ho about AGI as ever, and it has done more than most to make AGI a mainstream multibillion-dollar concern. It’s not there yet, though. I asked Chen and Pachocki what they think is missing.



“I think the way to envision the future is to really, deeply study the technology that we see today,” Pachocki said. “From the beginning, OpenAI has looked at deep learning as this very mysterious and clearly very powerful technology with a lot of potential. We’ve been trying to understand its bottlenecks. What can it do? What can it not do?”&nbsp;&nbsp;



At the current cutting edge, Chen said, are reasoning models, which break down problems into smaller, more manageable steps, but even they have limits: “You know, you have these models which know a lot of things but can’t chain that knowledge together. Why is that? Why can’t it do that in a way that humans can?”



OpenAI is throwing everything at answering that question.



“We are probably still, like, at the very beginning of this reasoning paradigm,” Pachocki told me. “Really, we are thinking about how to get these models to learn and explore over the long term and actually deliver very new ideas.”



Chen pushed the point home: “I really don’t consider reasoning done. We’ve definitely not solved it. You have to read so much text to get a kind of approximation of what humans know.”



OpenAI won’t say what data it uses to train its models or give details about their size and shape—only that it is working hard to make all stages of the development process more efficient.



Those efforts make them confident that so-called scaling laws—which suggest that models will continue to get better the more compute you throw at them—show no sign of breaking down.



“I don’t think there’s evidence that scaling laws are dead in any sense,” Chen insisted. “There have always been bottlenecks, right? Sometimes they’re to do with the way models are built. Sometimes they’re to do with data. But fundamentally it’s just about finding the research that breaks you through the current bottleneck.”&nbsp;



The faith in progress is unshakeable. I brought up something Pachocki had said about AGI in an interview with Nature in May: “When I joined OpenAI in 2017, I was still among the biggest skeptics at the company.” He looked doubtful.&nbsp;



“I’m not sure I was skeptical about the concept,” he said. “But I think I was—” He paused, looking at his hands on the table in front of him. “When I joined OpenAI, I expected the timelines to be longer to get to the point that we are now.”





“There’s a lot of consequences of AI,” he said. “But the one I think the most about is automated research. When we look at human history, a lot of it is about technological progress, about humans building new technologies. The point when computers can develop new technologies themselves seems like a very important, um, inflection point.



“We already see these models assist scientists. But when they are able to work on longer horizons—when they’re able to establish research programs for themselves—the world will feel meaningfully different.”



For Chen, that ability for models to work by themselves for longer is key. “I mean, I do think everyone has their own definitions of AGI,” he said. “But this concept of autonomous time—just the amount of time that the model can spend making productive progress on a difficult problem without hitting a dead end—that’s one of the big things that we’re after.”



It’s a bold vision—and far beyond the capabilities of today’s models. But I was nevertheless struck by how Chen and Pachocki made AGI sound almost mundane. Compare this with how Sutskever responded when I spoke to him 18 months ago. “It’s going to be monumental, earth-shattering,” he told me. “There will be a before and an after.” Faced with the immensity of what he was building, Sutskever switched the focus of his career from designing better and better models to figuring out how to control a technology that he believed would soon be smarter than himself.



Two years ago Sutskever set up what he called a superalignment team that he would co-lead with another OpenAI safety researcher, Jan Leike. The claim was that this team would funnel a full fifth of OpenAI’s resources into figuring out how to control a hypothetical superintelligence. Today, most of the people on the superalignment team, including Sutskever and Leike, have left the company and the team no longer exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



When Leike quit, he said it was because the team had not been given the support he felt it deserved. He posted this on X: “Building smarter-than-human machines is an inherently dangerous endeavor. OpenAI is shouldering an enormous responsibility on behalf of all of humanity. But over the past years, safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products.” Other departing researchers shared similar statements.



I asked Chen and Pachocki what they make of such concerns. “A lot of these things are highly personal decisions,” Chen said. “You know, a researcher can kind of, you know—”



He started again. “They might have a belief that the field is going to evolve in a certain way and that their research is going to pan out and is going to bear fruit. And, you know, maybe the company doesn’t reshape in the way that you want it to. It’s a very dynamic field.”



“A lot of these things are personal decisions,” he repeated. “Sometimes the field is just evolving in a way that is less consistent with the way that you’re doing research.”



But alignment, both of them insist, is now part of the core business rather than the concern of one specific team. According to Pachocki, these models don’t work at all unless they work as you expect them to. There’s also little desire to focus on aligning a hypothetical superintelligence with your objectives when doing so with existing models is already enough of a challenge.



“Two years ago the risks that we were imagining were mostly theoretical risks,” Pachocki said. “The world today looks very different, and I think a lot of alignment problems are now very practically motivated.”



Still, experimental technology is being spun into mass-market products faster than ever before. Does that really never lead to disagreements between the two of them?



“I am often afforded the luxury of really kind of thinking about the long term, where the technology is headed,” Pachocki said. “Contending with the reality of the process—both in terms of people and also, like, the broader company needs—falls on Mark. It’s not really a disagreement, but there is a natural tension between these different objectives and the different challenges that the company is facing that materializes between us.”



Chen jumped in: “I think it’s just a very delicate balance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;



Correction: we have removed a line referring to an Altman message on X about GPT-5. We amended who was behind OpenAI&#8217;s reasoning models to include reference to Sutskever.

🔒 Cybersecurity & Privacy
• Scammers Unleash Flood of Slick Online Gaming Sites
  Fraudsters are flooding Discord and other social media platforms with ads for hundreds of polished online gaming and wagering websites that lure people with free credits and eventually abscond with any cryptocurrency funds deposited by players. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the social engineering tactics and remarkable traits of this sprawling network of more than 1,200 scam sites.
The scam begins with deceptive ads posted on social media that claim the wagering sites are working in partnership with popular social media personalities, such as Mr. Beast, who recently launched a gaming business called Beast Games. The ads invariably state that by using a supplied &#8220;promo code,&#8221; interested players can claim a $2,500 credit on the advertised gaming website.
An ad posted to a Discord channel for a scam gambling website that the proprietors falsely claim was operating in collaboration with the Internet personality Mr. Beast. Image: Reddit.com.
The gaming sites all require users to create a free account to claim their $2,500 credit, which they can use to play any number of extremely polished video games that ask users to bet on each action. At the scam website gamblerbeast[.]com, for example, visitors can pick from dozens of games like B-Ball Blitz, in which you play a basketball pro who is taking shots from the free throw line against a single opponent, and you bet on your ability to sink each shot.
The financial part of this scam begins when users try to cash out any &#8220;winnings.&#8221; At that point, the gaming site will reject the request and prompt the user to make a &#8220;verification deposit&#8221; of cryptocurrency &#8212; typically around $100 &#8212; before any money can be distributed. Those who deposit cryptocurrency funds are soon asked for additional payments.

However, any &#8220;winnings&#8221; displayed by these gaming sites are a complete fantasy, and players who deposit cryptocurrency funds will never see that money again. Compounding the problem, victims likely will soon be peppered with come-ons from &#8220;recovery experts&#8221; who peddle dubious claims on social media networks about being able to retrieve funds lost to such scams.
KrebsOnSecurity first learned about this network of phony betting sites from a Discord user who asked to be identified only by their screen name: &#8220;Thereallo&#8221; is a 17-year-old developer who operates multiple Discord servers and said they began digging deeper after users started complaining of being inundated with misleading spam messages promoting the sites.
&#8220;We were being spammed relentlessly by these scam posts from compromised or purchased [Discord] accounts,&#8221; Thereallo said. &#8220;I got frustrated with just banning and deleting, so I started to investigate the infrastructure behind the scam messages. This is not a one-off site, it&#8217;s a scalable criminal enterprise with a clear playbook, technical fingerprints, and financial infrastructure.&#8221;
After comparing the code on the gaming sites promoted via spam messages, Thereallo found they all invoked the same API key for an online chatbot that appears to be in limited use or else is custom-made. Indeed, a scan for that API key at the threat hunting platform Silent Push reveals at least 1,270 recently-registered and active domains whose names all invoke some type of gaming or wagering theme.
The &#8220;verification deposit&#8221; stage of the scam requires the user to deposit cryptocurrency in order to withdraw their &#8220;winnings.&#8221;
Thereallo said the operators of this scam empire appear to generate a unique Bitcoin wallet for each gaming domain they deploy.
&#8220;This is a decoy wallet,&#8221; Thereallo explained. &#8220;Once the victim deposits funds, they are never able to withdraw any money. Any attempts to contact the &#8216;Live Support&#8217; are handled by a combination of AI and human operators who eventually block the user. The chat system is self-hosted, making it difficult to report to third-party service providers.&#8221;
Thereallo discovered another feature common to all of these scam gambling sites [hereafter referred to simply as &#8220;scambling&#8221; sites]: If you register at one of them and then very quickly try to register at a sister property of theirs from the same Internet address and device, the registration request is denied at the second site.
&#8220;I registered on one site, then hopped to another to register again,&#8221; Thereallo said. Instead, the second site returned an error stating that a new account couldn&#8217;t be created for another 10 minutes.
The scam gaming site spinora dot cc shares the same chatbot API as more than 1,200 similar fake gaming sites.
&#8220;They&#8217;re tracking my VPN IP across their entire network,&#8221; Thereallo explained. &#8220;My password manager also proved it. It tried to use my dummy email on a site I had never visited, and the site told me the account already existed. So it&#8217;s definitely one entity running a single platform with 1,200+ different domain names as front-ends. This explains how their support works, a central pool of agents handling all the sites. It also explains why they&#8217;re so strict about not giving out wallet addresses; it&#8217;s a network-wide policy.&#8221;
In many ways, these scambling sites borrow from the playbook of &#8220;pig butchering&#8221; schemes, a rampant and far more elaborate crime in which people are gradually lured by flirtatious strangers online into investing in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms.
Pig butchering scams are typically powered by people in Asia who have been kidnapped and threatened with physical harm or worse unless they sit in a cubicle and scam Westerners on the Internet all day. In contrast, these scambling sites tend to steal far less money from individual victims, but their cookie-cutter nature and automated support components may enable their operators to extract payments from a large number of people in far less time, and with considerably less risk and up-front investment.
Silent Push&#8217;s Zach Edwards said the proprietors of this scambling empire are spending big money to make the sites look and feel like some fancy new type of casino.
&#8220;That&#8217;s a very odd type of pig butchering network and not like what we typically see, with much lower investments in the sites and lures,&#8221; Edwards said.
Here is a list of all domains that Silent Push found were using the scambling network&#8217;s chat API.

🏢 Corporate AI
• Introducing Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool
  At AWS Summit New York City 2025, Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced the preview of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore browser tool, a fully managed, pre-built cloud-based browser. This tool enables generative AI agents to interact seamlessly with websites. It addresses two fundamental limitations: first, foundation models (FMs) are trained on large but static datasets and need dynamic access to current information when API access isn’t readily available; second, organizations face significant challenges when attempting to scale web automation with AI for enterprise use cases. 
The development of agentic AI systems is moving toward applications that can execute complex, multistep tasks. For these agents to be effective, they require access to dynamic, real-time data, particularly from websites and web applications that don’t offer APIs or where API integration would be complex. Moreover, as businesses seek to deploy AI-powered automation across their operations, they need solutions that can reliably scale without the operational overhead of managing browser farms or solving complex concurrency issues. The AgentCore Browser Tool provides these capabilities, allowing agents to perform tasks such as automating research, streamlining operations, and interacting with web-based applications—all with the scalability, reliability, and security of the AWS Cloud infrastructure. By providing a fully managed cloud-based browser, AWS addresses the critical need for enterprises to deploy AI automation at scale across thousands of concurrent sessions, supporting use cases from customer service automation to large-scale data collection and analysis, without the traditional complexity and resource constraints of self-managed browser automation frameworks. 
In this post, we introduce the newly announced Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. We explore why organizations need cloud-based browser automation and the limitations it addresses for FMs that require real-time data access. We talk about key use cases and the core capabilities of the AgentCore Browser Tool. We walk through how to get started with the tool. 
Why do you need the cloud-based AgentCore Browser Tool? 
Traditional browser automation approaches have typically required significant infrastructure management, security considerations, and development expertise. The introduction of a fully managed, cloud-based browser automation solution addresses several critical needs, including simplified infrastructure management, enterprise-grade security, global availability and scaling, and cost optimization. Organizations no longer need to provision, maintain, and scale browser instances to support their automation needs. AWS now handles the complex infrastructure requirements, so developers can focus on building intelligent agent capabilities rather than managing browser farms. Cloud-based browser automation provides isolated execution environments with AWS security controls, reducing the risk of data exfiltration or unauthorized access that might occur in less controlled environments. With a cloud-based browser, you can instantaneously deploy browser instances across the global infrastructure of AWS so that browser automation can scale. By offering browser automation as a managed service, organizations can use a consumption-based pricing model instead of maintaining always-on infrastructure, which can substantially reduce costs for intermittent workloads. 
Use cases for cloud-based browser automation 
Handling repetitive web tasks: With the introduction of Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool, organizations can now implement sophisticated browser automation at scale. Cloud-based browser automation excels at minimizing manual execution of repetitive tasks across web interfaces. AI agents can populate complex web forms across multiple systems, validate entries, and maintain compliance with business rules. Agents can navigate to internal dashboards, extract critical metrics, and compile reports without human intervention. For organizations managing large user-generated content domains, agents can assist human moderators by prescreening content across multiple web interfaces. 
AI powered research and intelligence gathering: With cloud-based browser automation, AI agents become powerful research assistants. They automatically track related websites for pricing changes, new product launches, or content updates with regular monitoring. You can use AI agents to gather and analyze consumer sentiment across various web forums, review sites, and social domains to inform product development. With the AgentCore Browser Tool, you can create automated systems that regularly scan trusted information sources to keep internal knowledge bases current. 
Complex workflow automation across systems: Many organizations operate across numerous web applications that lack integrated workflows. Use the AgentCore Browser Tool to automate customer setup across multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems when APIs are unavailable. This helps maintain consistency and reduces error rates. You can monitor supplier portals, inventory systems, and logistics services to maintain visibility across complex supply chains. By automating account creation and permission settings across numerous internal web applications, employee onboarding becomes streamlined. 
Testing and quality assurance: Cloud-based browser automation enables robust testing at scale. You can use AgentCore Browser Tool to validate user experiences and functionality across different scenarios, devices, and browsers in parallel. Deploy agents to continuously interact with critical business applications and set up alerts to your teams about performance issues before customers encounter them. With AgentCore Browser Tool, you can regularly test web applications for accessibility compliance, security vulnerabilities, or regulatory requirements. 
Legacy system integration: Many organizations maintain legacy systems that lack modern APIs. Enable modern AI capabilities to interact with legacy web applications that would be costly to replace or modernize. Apply intelligent automation to systems that were never designed for programmatic access. As a result, you can extract valuable organizational data trapped in older web applications through regular, automated harvesting.

How an AI agent can use AgentCore Browser Tool 
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser runs in a secure, isolated containerized environment within AgentCore, insulating web activity from your local system. You can interact with the AgentCore Browser Tool using browser actuation libraries, such as Playwright, or use AI agentic frameworks specialized for browser automation, such as Amazon Nova Act and Browser Use. You can also integrate browser automation as a tool in a multi-agentic workflow. 
Amazon Nova Act or Browser Use works with the AgentCore Browser Tool to take natural language instructions from the user and convert them to actuations on the browser by following this workflow: 
 
 The user sends a query such as “search for shoes on Amazon” 
 An agentic framework such as Amazon Nova Act or Browser Use passes the query to the large language model (LLM) 
 The LLM reasons and generates instructions in a structured output format (for example, JSON encoded) 
 The agentic framework maps these instructions into browser actuation commands (such as Playwright, Puppeteer, or Selenium) 
 The browser actuation commands are executed on the AgentCore Browser over a secure WebSocket connection 
 The response from the browser and a screenshot are sent to the agent to reason further 
 
This process repeats until the original task is complete. The flow is illustrated in the following diagram. 
 
Get started 
The Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool is available for use today. For a collection of open source examples, visit the amazon-bedrock-agentcore-samples repository on GitHub.

For browser visualization on your local machine, you need the BrowserViewerServer component in the repository you cloned at: 01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/interactive_tools 
You can also visualize the browser live on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console at https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/builtInTools 
The following Python code demonstrates how to use the AgentCore Browser Tool directly with the Playwright library and the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore SDK. This example initiates a secure browser session, connects to it, and automates a straightforward workflow in which it navigates to https://www.amazon.com and searches for a product. 
 
 To get started with playwright: 
 
 
 cd 01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool 
 
 
 Install dependencies: 
 
 
 pip install playwright 
 
 
 Author your playwright-based script: 
 
 
 from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright, Playwright, BrowserType
from bedrock_agentcore.tools.browser_client import browser_session
from browser_viewer import BrowserViewerServer
import time
from rich.console import Console
console = Console()
def run(playwright: Playwright):
    # Create the browser session and keep it alive
    with browser_session('us-west-2') as client:
        ws_url, headers = client.generate_ws_headers()
        # Start viewer server
        viewer = BrowserViewerServer(client, port=8005)
        viewer_url = viewer.start(open_browser=True)
        # Connect using headers
        chromium: BrowserType = playwright.chromium
        browser = chromium.connect_over_cdp(
            ws_url,
            headers=headers
        )
        context = browser.contexts[0]
        page = context.pages[0]
        try:
            page.goto("https://amazon.com/")
            console.print(page.title())
            # Keep running
            while True:
                time.sleep(120)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            console.print("\n\n[yellow]Shutting down...[/yellow]")
            if 'client' in locals():
                client.stop()
                console.print("✅ Browser session terminated")
        except Exception as e:
            console.print(f"\n[red]Error: {e}[/red]")
            import traceback
            traceback.print_exc()
with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright) 
 
Alternatively, you can build a browser agent using Amazon Nova Act to automate web interactions: 
 
 Sign up for Nova Act at https://nova.amazon.com/act and generate an API key. 
 In the same Python virtual environment: 
 
pip install nova-act 
 
 Author your Nova Act based script: 
 
 
 import time
from bedrock_agentcore.tools.browser_client import browser_session
from nova_act import NovaAct
from rich.console import Console
from browser_viewer import BrowserViewerServer
 
NOVA_ACT_API_KEY = "YOUR_NOVA_ACT_API_KEY"
console = Console() 
 
def main():
    try:
        # Step 1: Create browser session
        with browser_session('us-west-2') as client:
            print("\r   ✅ Browser ready!                    ")
            ws_url, headers = client.generate_ws_headers()
 
            # Step 2: Start viewer server
            console.print("\n[cyan]Step 3: Starting viewer server...[/cyan]")
            viewer = BrowserViewerServer(client, port=8005)
            viewer_url = viewer.start(open_browser=True)
 
            # Step 3: Use Nova Act to interact with the browser with NovaAct
            with NovaAct(
                    cdp_endpoint_url=ws_url,
                    cdp_headers=headers,
                    preview={"playwright_actuation": True},
                    nova_act_api_key=NOVA_ACT_API_KEY,
                    starting_page="https://www.amazon.com",
                ) as nova_act:
                    result = nova_act.act("Search for coffee maker and get the details of the lowest priced one on the first page")

• Introducing the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter
  AI agents have reached a critical inflection point where their ability to generate sophisticated code exceeds the capacity to execute it safely in production environments. Organizations deploying agentic AI face a fundamental dilemma: although large language models (LLMs) can produce complex code scripts, mathematical analyses, and data visualizations, executing this AI-generated code introduces significant security vulnerabilities and operational complexity. 
In this post, we introduce the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter, a fully managed service that enables AI agents to securely execute code in isolated sandbox environments. We discuss how the AgentCore Code Interpreter helps solve challenges around security, scalability, and infrastructure management when deploying AI agents that need computational capabilities. We walk through the service’s key features, demonstrate how it works with practical examples, and show you how to get started with building your own agents using popular frameworks like Strands, LangChain, and LangGraph. 
Security and scalability challenges with AI-generated code 
Consider an example where an AI agent needs perform analysis on multi-year sales projections data for a product, to understand anomalies, trends, and seasonality. The analysis should be grounded in logic, repeatable, handle data securely, and scalable over large data and multiple iterations, if needed. Although LLMs excel at understanding and explaining concepts, they lack the ability to directly manipulate data or perform consistent mathematical operations at scale. LLMs alone are often inadequate for complex data analysis tasks like these, due to their inherent limitations in processing large datasets, performing precise calculations, and generating visualizations. This is where code interpretation and execution tools become essential, providing the capability to execute precise calculations, handle large datasets efficiently, and create reproducible analyses through programming languages and specialized libraries. Furthermore, implementing code interpretation capabilities comes with significant considerations. Organizations must maintain secure sandbox environments to help prevent malicious code execution, manage resource allocation, and maintain data privacy. The infrastructure requires regular updates, robust monitoring, and careful scaling strategies to handle increasing demand. 
Traditional approaches to code execution in AI systems suffer from several limitations: 
 
 Security vulnerabilities – Executing untrusted AI-generated code in production environments exposes organizations to code injection threats, unauthorized system access, and potential data breaches. Without proper sandboxing, malicious or poorly constructed code can compromise entire infrastructure stacks. 
 Infrastructure overhead – Building secure execution environments requires extensive DevOps expertise, including container orchestration, network isolation, resource monitoring, and security hardening. Many organizations lack the specialized knowledge to implement these systems correctly. 
 Scalability bottlenecks – Traditional code execution environments struggle with the dynamic, unpredictable workloads generated by AI agents. Peak demand can overwhelm static infrastructure, and idle periods waste computational resources. 
 Integration complexity – Connecting secure code execution capabilities with existing AI frameworks often requires custom development, creating maintenance overhead and limiting adoption across development teams. 
 Compliance challenges – Enterprise environments demand comprehensive audit trails, access controls, and compliance certifications that are difficult to implement and maintain in custom solutions. 
 
These barriers have prevented organizations from fully using the computational capabilities of AI agents, limiting their applications to simple, deterministic tasks rather than the complex, code-dependent workflows that could maximize business value. 
Introducing the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Code Interpreter 
With the AgentCore Core Interpreter, AI agents can write and execute code securely in sandbox environments, enhancing their accuracy and expanding their ability to solve complex end-to-end tasks. This purpose-built service minimizes the security, scalability, and integration challenges that have hindered AI agent deployment by providing a fully managed, enterprise-grade code execution system specifically designed for agentic AI workloads. The AgentCore Code Interpreter is designed and built from the ground up for AI-generated code, with built-in safeguards, dynamic resource allocation, and seamless integration with popular AI frameworks. It offers advanced configuration support and seamless integration with popular frameworks, so developers can build powerful agents for complex workflows and data analysis while meeting enterprise security requirements. 
Transforming AI agent capabilities 
The AgentCore Code Interpreter powers advanced use cases by addressing several critical enterprise requirements: 
 
 Enhanced security posture – Configurable network access options range from fully isolated environments, which provide enhanced security by helping prevent AI-generated code from accessing external systems, to controlled network connectivity that provides flexibility for specific development needs and use cases. 
 Zero infrastructure management – The fully managed service minimizes the need for specialized DevOps resources, reducing time-to-market from months to days while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and security. 
 Dynamic scalability – Automatic resource allocation handles varying AI agent workloads without manual intervention, providing low-latency session start-up times during peak demand while optimizing costs during idle periods. 
 Framework agnostic integration – It integrates with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, with native support for popular AI frameworks including Strands, LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI, so teams can use existing investments while maintaining development velocity. 
 Enterprise compliance – Built-in access controls and comprehensive audit trails facilitate regulatory compliance without additional development overhead. 
 
Purpose-built for AI agent code execution 
The AgentCore Code Interpreter represents a shift in how AI agents interact with computational resources. This operation processes the agent generated code, runs it in a secure environment, and returns the execution results, including output, errors, and generated visualizations. The service operates as a secure, isolated execution environment where AI agents can run code (Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript), perform complex data analysis, generate visualizations, and execute mathematical computations without compromising system security. Each execution occurs within a dedicated sandbox environment that provides complete isolation from other workloads and the broader AWS infrastructure. What distinguishes the AgentCore Code Interpreter from traditional execution environments is its optimization for AI-generated workloads. The service handles the unpredictable nature of AI-generated code through intelligent resource management, automatic error handling, and built-in security safeguards specifically designed for untrusted code execution. 
Key features and capabilities of AgentCore Code Interpreter include:

   AWS CloudTrail integration providing audit trails for compliance 
    
 
How the AgentCore Code Interpreter works 
To understand the functionality of the AgentCore Code Interpreter, let’s examine the orchestrated flow of a typical data analysis request from an AI agent, as illustrated in the following diagram. 
 
The workflow consists of the following key components: 
 
 Deployment and invocation – An agent is built and deployed (for instance, on the AgentCore Runtime) using a framework like Strands, LangChain, LangGraph, or CrewAI. When a user sends a prompt (for example, “Analyze this sales data and show me the trend by salesregion”), the AgentCore Runtime initiates a secure, isolated session. 
 Reasoning and tool selection – The agent’s underlying LLM analyzes the prompt and determines that it needs to perform a computation. It then selects the AgentCore Code Interpreter as the appropriate tool. 
 Secure code execution – The agent generates a code snippet, for instance using the pandas library, to read a data file and matplotlib to create a plot. This code is passed to the AgentCore Code Interpreter, which executes it within its dedicated, sandboxed session. The agent can read from and write files to the session-specific file system. 
 Observation and iteration – The AgentCore Code Interpreter returns the result of the execution—such as a calculated value, a dataset, an image file of a graph, or an error message—to the agent. This feedback loop allows the agent to engage in iterative problem-solving by debugging its own code and refining its approach. 
 Context and memory – The agent maintains context for subsequent turns in the conversation, during the duration of the session. Alternatively, the entire interaction can be persisted in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory for long-term storage and retrieval. 
 Monitoring and observability – Throughout this process, a detailed trace of the agent’s execution, providing visibility into agent behavior, performance metrics, and logs, is available for debugging and auditing purposes. 
 
Practical real-world applications and use cases 
The AgentCore Code Interpreter can be applied to real-world business problems that are difficult to solve with LLMs alone. 
Use case 1: Automated financial analysis 
An agent can be tasked with performing on-demand analysis of financial data. For this example, a user provides a CSV file of billing data within the following prompt and asks for analysis and visualization: “Using the billing data provided below, create a bar graph that shows the total spend by product category… After generating the graph, provide a brief interpretation of the results…”The agent takes the following actions: 
 
 The agent receives the prompt and the data file containing the raw data. 
 It invokes the AgentCore Code Interpreter, generating Python code with the pandas library to parse the data into a DataFrame. The agent then generates another code block to group the data by category and sum the costs, and asks the AgentCore Code Interpreter to execute it. 
 The agent uses matplotlib to generate a bar chart and the AgentCore Code Interpreter saves it as an image file. 
 The agent returns both a textual summary of the findings and the generated PNG image of the graph. 
 
Use case 2: Interactive data science assistant 
The AgentCore Code Interpreter’s stateful session supports a conversational and iterative workflow for data analysis. For this example, a data scientist uses an agent for exploratory data analysis. The workflow is as follows: 
 
 The user provides a prompt: “Load dataset.csv and provide descriptive statistics.” 
 The agent generates and executes pandas.read_csv('dataset.csv') followed by .describe()and returns the statistics table. 
 The user prompts, “Plot a scatter plot of column A versus column B.” 
 The agent, using the dataset already loaded in its session, generates code with matplotlib.pyplot.scatter() and returns the plot. 
 The user prompts, “Run a simple linear regression and provide the R^2 value.” 
 The agent generates code using the scikit-learn library to fit a model and calculate the R^2 metric. 
 
This demonstrates iterative code execution capabilities, which allow agents to work through complex data science problems in a turn-by-turn manner with the user.

 @tool
def execute_python(code: str, description: str = "") -&gt; str:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"""Execute Python code in the sandbox."""
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if description:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;code = f"# {description}\n{code}"
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print(f"\n Generated Code: {code}")
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for event in response["stream"]:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return json.dumps(event["result"])

) 
 
Invoke the agent 
Test the AgentCore Code Interpreter powered agent with a simple prompt: 
 
 query&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me the largest random prime number between 1 and 100, which is less than 84 and more that 9"
try:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;response_text = ""
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;async for event in agent.stream_async(query):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if "data" in event:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;chunk = event["data"]
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;response_text += chunk
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print(chunk, end="")
except Exception as e:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;print(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}") 
 
We get the following result: 
 
 I'll find the largest random prime number between 1 and 100 that is less than 84 and more than 9. To do this, I'll write code to:

1. Generate all prime numbers in the specified range
2. Filter to keep only those &gt; 9 and &lt; 84
3. Find the largest one

Let me implement this:
&nbsp;Generated Code: import random

def is_prime(n):
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"""Check if a number is prime"""
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if n &lt;= 1:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return False
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if n &lt;= 3:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return True
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return False
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;i = 5
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;while i * i &lt;= n:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return False
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;i += 6
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;return True

# Find all primes in the range
primes_in_range = [n for n in range(10, 84) if is_prime(n)]

print("All prime numbers between 10 and 83:")
print(primes_in_range)

# Get the largest prime in the range
largest_prime = max(primes_in_range)
print(f"\nThe largest prime number between 10 and 83 is: {largest_prime}")

# For verification, let's check that it's actually prime
print(f"Verification - is {largest_prime} prime? {is_prime(largest_prime)}")
Based on the code execution, I can tell you that the largest prime number between 1 and 100, which is less than 84 and more than 9, is **83**.

I verified this by:
1. Writing a function to check if a number is prime
2. Generating all prime numbers in the range 10-83
3. Finding the maximum value in that list

The complete list of primes in your specified range is: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, and 83.

Since 83 is the largest among these primes, it is the answer to your question.

• Observing and evaluating AI agentic workflows with Strands Agents SDK and Arize AX
  This post is co-written with Rich Young from Arize AI. 
Agentic AI applications built on agentic workflows differ from traditional workloads in one important way: they’re nondeterministic. That is, they can produce different results with the same input. This is because the large language models (LLMs) they’re based on use probabilities when generating each token. This inherent unpredictability can lead AI application designers to ask questions related to the correction plan of action, the optimal path of an agent and the correct set of tools with the right parameters. Organizations that want to deploy such agentic workloads need an observability system that can make sure that they’re producing results that are correct and can be trusted. 
In this post, we present how the Arize AX service can trace and evaluate AI agent tasks initiated through Strands Agents, helping validate the correctness and trustworthiness of agentic workflows. 
Challenges with generative AI applications 
The path from a promising AI demo to a reliable production system is fraught with challenges that many organizations underestimate. Based on industry research and real-world deployments, teams face several critical hurdles: 
 
 Unpredictable behavior at scale – Agents that perform well in testing might fail with unexpected inputs in production, such as new language variations or domain-specific jargon that cause irrelevant or misunderstood responses. 
 Hidden failure modes – Agents can produce plausible but wrong outputs or skip steps unnoticed, such as miscalculating financial metrics in a way that seems correct but misleads decision-making. 
 Nondeterministic paths – Agents might choose inefficient or incorrect decision paths, such as taking 10 steps to route a query that should take only 5, leading to poor user experiences. 
 Tool integration complexity – Agents can break when calling APIs incorrectly, for example, passing the wrong order ID format so that a refund silently fails despite a successful inventory update. 
 Cost and performance variability – Loops or verbose outputs can cause runaway token costs and latency spikes, such as an agent making more than 20 LLM calls and delaying a response from 3 to 45 seconds. 
 
These challenges mean that traditional testing and monitoring approaches are insufficient for AI systems. Success requires a more thoughtful approach that incorporates a more comprehensive strategy. 
Arize AX delivers a comprehensive observability, evaluation, and experimentation framework 
Arize AX is the enterprise-grade AI engineering service that helps teams monitor, evaluate, and debug AI applications from development to production lifecycle. Incorporating Arize’s Phoenix foundation, AX adds enterprise essentials such as the “Alyx” AI assistant, online evaluations, automatic prompt optimization, role-based access control (RBAC), and enterprise scale and support. AX offers a comprehensive solution to organizations that caters to both technical and nontechnical personas so they can manage and improve AI agents from development through production at scale. Arize AX capabilities include: 
 
 Tracing – Full visibility into LLM operations using OpenTelemetry to capture model calls, retrieval steps, and metadata such as tokens and latency for detailed analysis. 
 Evaluation – Automated quality monitoring with LLM-as-a-judge evaluations on production samples, supporting custom evaluators and clear success metrics. 
 Datasets – Maintain versioned, representative datasets for edge cases, regression tests, and A/B testing, refreshed with real production examples. 
 Experiments – Run controlled tests to measure the impact of changes to prompts or models, validating improvements with statistical rigor. 
 Playground – Interactive environment to replay traces, test prompt variations, and compare model responses for effective debugging and optimization. 
 Prompt management – Version, test, and deploy prompts like code, with performance tracking and gradual rollouts to catch regressions early. 
 Monitoring and alerting – Real-time dashboards and alerts for latency, errors, token usage, and drift, with escalation for critical issues. 
 Agent visualization – Analyze and optimize agent decision paths to reduce loops and inefficiencies, refining planning strategies. 
 
These components form a comprehensive observability strategy that treats LLM applications as mission-critical production systems requiring continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement. 
Arize AX and Strands Agents: A powerful combination 
Strands Agents is an open source SDK, a powerful low-code framework for building and running AI agents with minimal overhead. Designed to simplify the development of sophisticated agent workflows, Strands unifies prompts, tools, LLM interactions, and integration protocols into a single streamlined experience. It supports both Amazon Bedrock hosted and external models, with built-in capabilities for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Agent2Agent (A2A) communication. In this section, we walk through building an agent with Strands Agent SDK, instrumenting it with Arize AX for trace-based evaluation, and optimizing its behavior. 
The following workflow shows how a Strands agent handles a user task end-to-end—invoking tools, retrieving context, and generating a response—while sending traces to Arize AX for evaluation and optimization. 
 
The solution follows these high-level steps: 
 
 Install and configure the dependencies 
 Instrument the agent for observability 
 Build the agent with Strands SDK

Build the agent with Strands SDK 
Create the Restaurant Assistant agent using Strands. This agent will help customers with restaurant information and reservations using several tools: 
 
 retrieve – Searches the knowledge base for restaurant information 
 current_time – Gets the current time for reservation scheduling 
 create_booking – Creates a new restaurant reservation 
 get_booking_details – Retrieves details of an existing reservation 
 delete_booking – Cancels an existing reservation 
 
The agent uses Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet model in Amazon Bedrock for natural language understanding and generation. Import the required tools and define the agent: 
 
 import get_booking_details, delete_booking, create_booking
from strands_tools import retrieve, current_time
from strands import Agent, tool
from strands.models.bedrock import BedrockModel
import boto3
system_prompt = """You are "Restaurant Helper", a restaurant assistant helping customers reserving tables in different restaurants. You can talk about the menus, create new bookings, get the details of an existing booking or delete an existing reservation. You reply always politely and mention your name in the reply (Restaurant Helper)..........."""
model = BedrockModel(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model_id="us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0",
)
kb_name = 'restaurant-assistant'
smm_client = boto3.client('ssm')
kb_id = smm_client.get_parameter(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Name=f'{kb_name}-kb-id',
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WithDecryption=False
)
os.environ["KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID"] = kb_id["Parameter"]["Value"]
agent = Agent(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model=model,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system_prompt=system_prompt,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tools=[
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;retrieve, current_time, get_booking_details,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;create_booking, delete_booking
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trace_attributes={
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"session.id": "abc-1234",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"user.id": "user-email-example@domain.com",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"arize.tags": [
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Agent-SDK",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Arize-Project",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"OpenInference-Integration",
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
) 
 
Test the agent and generate traces 
Test the agent with a couple of queries to generate traces for Arize. Each interaction will create spans in OpenTelemetry that will be processed by the custom processor and sent to Arize AI.The first test case is a restaurant information query. Ask about restaurants in San Francisco. This will trigger the knowledge base retrieval tool: 
 
 # Test with a question about restaurants
results = agent("Hi, where can I eat in New York?")
print(results) 
 
The second test case is for a restaurant reservation. Test the booking functionality by making a reservation. This will trigger the create_booking tool: 
 
 # Test with a reservation request
results = agent("Make a reservation for tonight at Rice &amp; Spice. At 8pm, for 2 people in the name of Anna")
print(results) 
 
Analyze traces in Arize AI 
After running the agent, you can view and analyze the traces in the Arize AI dashboard, shown in the following screenshot. Trace-level visualization shows the representation of the trace to confirm the path that the agent took during execution. In the Arize dashboard, you can review the traces generated by the agent. By selecting the strands-project you defined in the notebook, you can view your traces on the LLM Tracing tab. Arize provides powerful filtering capabilities to help you focus on specific traces. You can filter by OTel attributes and metadata, for example, to analyze performance across different models. 
 
You can also use Alyx AI assistant, to analyze your agent’s behavior through natural language queries and uncover insights. In the example below, we use Alyx to reason about why a tool was invoked incorrectly by the agent in one of the traces, helping us identify the root cause of the misstep 
 
Choosing a specific trace gives detailed information about the agent’s runtime performance and decision-making process, as shown in the following screenshot. 
 
The graph view, shown in the following screenshot, shows the hierarchical structure of your agent’s execution and users can inspect specific execution paths to understand how the agent made decisions by selecting the graph. 
 
You can also view session-level insights on the Sessions tab next to LLM Tracing. By tagging spans with session.id and user.id, you can group related interactions, identify where conversations break down, track user frustration, and evaluate multiturn performance across sessions. 
Evaluate the agent’s behavior 
Arize’s system traces the agent’s decision-making process, capturing details such as routing decisions, tool calls and parameters. You can evaluate performance by analyzing these traces to verify that the agent selects optimal paths and provides accurate responses. For example, if the agent misinterprets a customer’s request and chooses the wrong tool or uses incorrect parameters, Arize evaluators will identify when these failures occur.Arize has pre-built evaluation templates for every step of your Agent process: 
 
 Agent Tool Calling 
   
   Agent Tool Selection 
   Agent Parameter Extraction 
    
 Agent Path Convergence 
 Agent Planning 
 Agent Reflection 
 
Create a new task under Evals and Tasks and choose LLM as a judge task type. You can use a pre-built prompt template (tool calling is used in the example shown in the following screenshot) or you can ask Alyx AI assistant to build one for you. Evals will now automatically run on your traces as they flow into Arize. This uses AI to automatically label your data and identify failures at scale without human intervention. 
 
Now every time the agent is invoked, trace data is collected in Arize and the tool calling evaluation automatically runs and labels the data with a correct or incorrect label along with an explanation by the LLM-as-a-judge for its labeling decision. Here is an example of an evaluation label and explanation. 
 
Optimize the agent 
The LLM-as-a-judge evaluations automatically identify and label failure cases where the agent didn’t call the right tool. In the below screenshot these failure cases are automatically captured and added to a regression dataset, which will drive agent improvement workflows. This production data can now fuel development cycles for improving the agent. 
 
Now, you can connect directly with Arize’s prompt playground, an integrated development environment (IDE) where you can experiment with various prompt changes and model choices, compare side-by-side results and test across the regression dataset from the previous step. When you have an optimal prompt and model combination, you can save this version to the prompt hub for future version tracking and retrieval, as shown in the following screenshot. 
 
Experiments from the prompt testing are automatically saved, with online evaluations run and results saved for immediate analysis and comparison to facilitate data-driven decisions on what enhancements to deploy. Additionally, experiments can be incorporated into continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows for automated regression testing and validation whenever new prompt or application changes are pushed to systems such as GitHub. The screenshot below shows hallucination metrics for prompt experiments. 
 
 
Continually monitor the agent 
To maintain reliability and performance in production, it’s essential to continually monitor your AI agents. Arize AI provides out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities that help teams detect issues early, optimize cost, and provide high-quality user experiences.Setting up monitors in Arize AI offers: 
 
 Early issue detection – Identify problems before they impact users 
 Performance tracking – Monitor trends and maintain consistent agent behavior 
 Cost management – Track token usage to avoid unnecessary expenses 
 Quality assurance – Validate your agent is delivering accurate, helpful responses 
 
You can access and configure monitors on the Monitors tab in your Arize project. For details, refer to the Arize documentation on monitoring. 
When monitoring your Strands Agent in production, pay close attention to these key metrics: 
 
 Latency – Time taken for the agent to respond to user inputs 
 Token usage – Number of tokens consumed, which directly impacts cost 
 Error rate – Frequency of failed responses or tool invocations 
 Tool usage – Effectiveness and frequency of tool calls 
 User satisfaction signals – Proxy metrics such as tool call correctness, conversation length, or resolution rates 
 
By continually monitoring these metrics, teams can proactively improve agent performance, catch regressions early, and make sure the system scales reliably in real-world use. In Arize, you can create custom metrics directly from OTel trace attributes or metadata, and even from evaluation labels and metrics, such as the tool calling correctness evaluation you created previously. The screenshot below visualizes the tool call correctness ratio across agent traces, helping identify patterns in correct versus incorrect tool usage 
 
The screenshot below illustrate how Arize provides customizable dashboards that enable deep observability into LLM agent performance, showcasing a custom monitoring dashboard tracking core metrics such as latency, token usage, and the percentage of correct tool calls. 
 
The screenshot below demonstrates prebuilt templates designed to accelerate setup and offer immediate visibility into key agent behaviors. 
 
Clean up 
When you’re done experimenting, you can clean up the AWS resources created by this notebook by running the cleanup script: !sh cleanup.sh.

• Building AIOps with Amazon Q Developer CLI and MCP Server
  IT teams face mounting challenges as they manage increasingly complex infrastructure and applications, often spending countless hours manually identifying operational issues, troubleshooting problems, and performing repetitive maintenance tasks. This operational burden diverts valuable technical resources from innovation and strategic initiatives. Artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) presents a transformative solution, using AI to automate operational workflows, detect anomalies, and resolve incidents with minimal human intervention. Organizations can optimize their operational efficiency while maintaining security as they manage their infrastructure and applications. 
You can use Amazon Q Developer CLI and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to build powerful AIOps solutions that can reduce manual effort through natural language interactions. Amazon Q Developer can help developers and IT professionals with many of their tasks—from coding, testing, and deploying, to troubleshooting, performing security scanning and fixes, modernizing applications, optimizing AWS resources, and creating data engineering pipelines. The MCP extends these capabilities by enabling Amazon Q to connect with custom tools and services through a standardized interface, allowing for more sophisticated operational automations. 
In this post, we discuss how to implement a low-code no-code AIOps solution that helps organizations monitor, identify, and troubleshoot operational events while maintaining their security posture. We show how these technologies work together to automate repetitive tasks, streamline incident response, and enhance operational efficiency across your organization. 
This is the third post in a series on AIOps using generative AI services on AWS. Refer to the following two posts for building AIOps using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Q Business: 
 
 Automate IT operations with Amazon Bedrock Agents 
 Building an AIOps chatbot with Amazon Q Business custom plugins 
 
Solution overview 
MCP servers act like a universal connector for AI models, enabling them to interact with external systems, fetch live data, and integrate with various tools seamlessly. This helps Amazon Q provide more contextually relevant assistance by accessing the information it needs in real time. The following architecture diagram illustrates how you can use a single configuration file, mcp.json, to configure MCP servers in Amazon Q Developer CLI to connect to external systems. 
 
The workflow consists of the following steps: 
 
 The user configures an MCP client in Amazon Q Developer CLI using the mcp.json file. 
 The user logs in to Amazon Q Developer CLI and asks operational queries in natural language. 
 Depending on your query, Amazon Q decides which MCP servers that you configured or existing tools to invoke to perform the task. 
 The MCP server interacts with the respective external system to get the live data that is used by Amazon Q to perform the required task. 
 
In this post, we show how to use Amazon Q Developer CLI to address the following operational issues: 
 
 Identify and remediate high CPU utilization in an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance 
 Identify and remove public access from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket 
 Identify and block a specific unwanted open port for inbound connection to an EC2 instance 
 
Prerequisites 
Complete the following prerequisites before you start setting up the demo: 
 
 Create an AWS account if you don’t already have one. 
 Make sure you have access to an AWS account through the AWS Management Console and AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). Your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user must have permissions to make the necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources mentioned in this post. While providing permissions to the IAM user, follow the principle of least-privilege. 
 Have Amazon Q for command line installed. Refer to Supported command line environments before installation. 
 
Configure MCP in Amazon Q Developer CLI 
MCP configuration in Amazon Q Developer CLI is managed through JSON files. You will configure the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base Retrieval MCP Server. At the time of writing, only the stdio transport is supported in Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
Amazon Q Developer CLI supports two levels of MCP configuration: 
 
 Global configuration – Uses ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json and applies to all workspaces 
 Workspace configuration – Uses .amazonq/mcp.json and is specific to the current workspace 
 
For this post, we use the workspace configuration, but you have option to use either of them. 
 
 Create a new workspace folder, and inside that folder, create the file .amazonq/mcp.json with the following content: 
 
 
 {
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.bedrock-kb-retrieval-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.bedrock-kb-retrieval-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name ",
        "AWS_REGION": "your-region",
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR",
        "KB_INCLUSION_TAG_KEY": "name=aiops-knowledge-base",
        "BEDROCK_KB_RERANKING_ENABLED": "false"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }  
  }
} 
 
See the AWS MCP Servers GitHub repository for an updated list of available MCP servers. 
 
 Open a terminal, navigate to the workspace folder that you created, and run the following command to log in to Amazon Q Developer CLI: 
 
 
 q login 
 
 
 Follow the instructions to log in to Amazon Q Developer on the command line. 
 Initiate the chat session by running q and then run /tools to validate that the Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base Retrieval MCP server is configured. 
 
Tool permissions have two possible states: 
 
 Trusted – Amazon Q can use the tool without asking for confirmation each time 
 Per-request – Amazon Q must ask for your confirmation each time before using the tool 
 
By default, this tool will not be trusted. 
 
5. Run /tools trust awslabsbedrock_kb_retrieval_mcp_server___QueryKnowledgeBases to trust the MCP server. 
6. Run the /tools command again to validate it. 
 
Deploy AWS resources 
Deploy the following AWS CloudFormation template to deploy the AWS resources that you will use to test AIOps. You can deploy this template in either the us-east-1 or us-west-2 AWS Region. You can deploy it in other Regions by updating the applicable AMI IDs in the template. This template will deploy two EC2 instances and three S3 buckets. 
This CloudFormation template is for demo purposes only and not meant for production usage.

Validate that the template deployed two EC2 instances, which are in Running state. 
 
Additionally, validate that the template created three S3 buckets with the names aiops-qdevcli-bucketX-&lt;your-AWS-account-Id&gt; and one bucket with the name aiops-qdevcli-&lt;your-AWS-account-Id&gt; in your selected Region. 
 
Create an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base 
Upload the sample high CPU utilization runbook to the aiops-qdevcli-&lt;your-AWS-account-Id&gt; bucket. Create a knowledge base pointing to the bucket, and note the knowledge base ID to use in the first example use case. 
Use case 1: Identify and remediate high CPU utilization in an EC2 instance 
In this use case, you introduce CPU stress in one of the EC2 instances and then use Amazon Q Developer CLI to identify and remediate it. 
 
 On the Amazon EC2 console, log in to the aiops-qdevcli-high-cpu-util instance using EC2 Instance Connect. 
 Run the following command to install stress-ng: 
 
 
 sudo dnf install stress-ng 
 
 
 Run the following command to stress the EC2 instance for 1 hour: 
 
 
 stress-ng --cpu 1 --timeout 3600s 
 
You must wait approximately 10 minutes for the Amazon CloudWatch alarm to get triggered. 
 
 Return to the Amazon EC2 console and check that the aiops-qdevcli-high-cpu-util instance is currently in Alarm state. 
 From the Amazon Q Developer CLI, use a natural language query to check for operation issues in your account. Use the knowledge base ID that you saved in the previous section. 
 
Amazon Q Developer CLI autocorrects the errors that it encountered while running the commands. 
Watch the following video for more details. 
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
Due to the inherent nondeterministic nature of the FMs, the responses you receive from Amazon Q Developer CLI might not be exactly the same as those shown in the demo. 
Use case 2: Identify and remove public access from an S3 bucket 
In this use case, you will simulate an accidental security issue by unblocking public access for one of the buckets and then use Amazon Q Developer CLI to identify and remediate the issue. 
 
 On the Amazon S3 console, open one of the aiops-qdevcli-xxxx buckets, and on the Permissions tab, choose Edit and change Block all public access to Off. 
 
 
 
 Return to the Amazon Q Developer CLI and ask questions in natural language to identify and remediate the operational issue. 
 
Watch the following video for more details. 

 
  
 
 
Use case 3: Identify and block a specific unwanted open port for inbound connection to an EC2 instance 
In this use case, you will use Amazon Q Developer CLI to identify the EC2 instance that has a specific port open and then close the port. 
 
 On the Amazon EC2 console, note that the aiops-qdevcli-open-port-demo instance has port 5080 open for all inbound TCP connections. This is an unwanted security risk that you want to identify and remediate. 
 
 
 
 Return to Amazon Q Developer CLI and use natural language queries to identify the EC2 instance with port 5080 open and fix the issue. 
 
Watch the following video for details. 

 
  
 
 
Clean up 
Properly decommissioning provisioned AWS resources is an important best practice to optimize costs and enhance security posture after concluding proofs of concept and demonstrations. Complete the following steps to delete the resources created in your AWS account: 
 
 On the Amazon Bedrock console, delete the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base. 
 On the Amazon S3 console, empty the aiops-qdevcli-kb-xxx bucket. 
 On the AWS CloudFormation console, delete the CloudFormation stack. 
 
As an alternative, try the preceding steps using natural language queries in Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
 
 Finally, delete the .amazonq/mcp.json file from your workspace folder to remove the MCP configuration for Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
 
Conclusion 
In this post, we showed how Amazon Q Developer CLI interprets natural language queries, automatically converts them into appropriate commands, and identifies the necessary tools for execution. The solution’s intelligent error-handling capabilities analyze logs and perform auto-corrections, minimizing manual intervention. By implementing Amazon Q Developer CLI, you can enhance your team’s operational efficiency, reduce human errors, and manage complex environments more effectively through a conversational interface.We encourage you to explore additional use cases and share your feedback with us.

• Containerize legacy Spring Boot application using Amazon Q Developer CLI and MCP server
  Organizations can optimize their migration and modernization projects by streamlining the containerization process for legacy applications. With the right tools and approaches, teams can transform traditional applications into containerized solutions efficiently, reducing the time spent on manual coding, testing, and debugging while enhancing developer productivity and accelerating time-to-market. During containerization initiatives, organizations can address compatibility, dependencies, and configurations efficiently using automated tools and best practices, helping to keep projects on schedule and within budget parameters. Development teams can focus more on innovation by automating routine tasks such as application architecture analysis, deployment script creation, and environment configuration, leading to smoother transitions across different stages of the modernization journey. 
In this post, you’ll learn how you can use Amazon Q Developer command line interface (CLI) with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers integration to modernize a legacy Java Spring Boot application running on premises and then migrate it to Amazon Web Services (AWS) by deploying it on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The Amazon Q Developer CLI helps automate common tasks in the modernization process. You’ll introduce chaos into the system after successful modernization. Then you’ll troubleshoot it using Amazon Q Developer CLI. You’ll perform all these activities using natural language prompts without writing code. 
Amazon Q Developer goes beyond coding to help developers and IT professionals with many of their tasks—from coding, testing, and deploying to troubleshooting, performing security scanning and fixes, modernizing applications, optimizing AWS resources, and creating data engineering pipelines. Amazon Q for the command line integrates contextual information, providing Amazon Q with an enhanced understanding of your use case, enabling it to provide relevant and context-aware responses. The MCP is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. It defines a structured way for AI models to discover available tools, request tool execution with specific parameters, and receive and process tool results. You’ll use MCP to extend the capabilities of Amazon Q Developer CLI by connecting it to custom tools and services. 
Although we’re showcasing the capability of Amazon Q Developer CLI in this end -to-end migration and modernization journey, if you’re using one of the supported integrated development environments (IDEs) and Java versions, you can use the /transform command to perform the step 2. For more information, visit Upgrading Java versions from Amazon Q Developer. 
Solution overview 
MCP servers act like a universal connector for AI models, enabling them to interact with external systems, fetch live data, and integrate with various tools seamlessly. This allows Amazon Q to provide more contextually relevant assistance by accessing the information it needs in real-time. The following architecture diagram shows how Amazon Q Developer CLI connects to external data sources through MCP servers. 
 
The following is a summary of the functionality of the architecture: 
 
 You’ll configure MCP client in Amazon Q Developer CLI using mcp.json file. 
 You’ll log in to Amazon Q Developer CLI and ask queries in natural language. 
 Depending on your query, Amazon Q Developer decides which MCP server(s) that you configured or existing tools to invoke for performing the task. At present, Amazon Q Developer supports stdio local MCP servers only. 
 The MCP server interacts with the respective external system to get the live data that is used by Amazon Q to perform the required task. 
 
The solution follows these high-level steps, as shown in the following graphic: 
 
 Create legacy Java Spring Boot application 
 Upgrade Java and Spring Boot versions 
 Containerize the upgraded application 
 Deploy the application on Amazon EKS 
 Introduce chaos 
 Troubleshoot and fix 
 
 
Prerequisites 
You need to have the following configured before you start setting up the demo: 
 
 Create an AWS account if you don’t already have one. 
 Have access to an AWS account through the AWS Management Console and the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI). The AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user that you use must have permissions to make the necessary AWS service calls and manage AWS resources mentioned in this post. While providing permissions to the IAM user, follow the principle of least privilege. 
 Have Amazon Q for command line installed. Refer to Supported command line environments before installation. 
 
Configure MCP in Amazon Q Developer CLI 
MCP configuration in Amazon Q Developer CLI is managed through JSON files. You’ll configure Amazon Bedrock EKS MCP Server. At the time of this writing, only the stdio transport is supported in Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
Amazon Q Developer CLI supports two levels of MCP configuration: 
 
 Global configuration: ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json – Applies to all workspaces 
 Workspace configuration: .amazonq/mcp.json – Specific to the current workspace 
 
In this demonstration, we’re using workspace configuration, but you can use either of them. Follow these steps: 
 
 Create a new workspace folder and inside that folder create .amazonq/mcp.json file with the following content: 
 
 
 {
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.eks-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "awslabs.eks-mcp-server",
        "--allow-write",
        "--allow-sensitive-data-access"
      ],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",
        "AWS_REGION": "your-region",        
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "autoApprove": [
        "manage_eks_stacks",
        "manage_k8s_resource",
        "list_k8s_resources",
        "get_pod_logs",
        "get_k8s_events",
        "get_cloudwatch_logs",
        "get_cloudwatch_metrics",
        "get_policies_for_role",
        "search_eks_troubleshoot_guide",
        "list_api_versions"
      ],
      "disabled": false
    }    
  }
} 
 
 
 Open a terminal, navigate to the workspace folder that you created in step 1, and enter the following command to log into Amazon Q Developer CLI. Follow the instruction on the screen to login to Amazon Q Developer on the command line: 
 
q login 
 
 Initiate the chat session by entering q and then /tools to validate that the Amazon EKS MCP server is configured, as shown in the following screenshot. By default, it won’t be trusted. 
 
 
Migrate and modernize Java Spring Boot application 
To migrate and modernize a Java Spring Boot application, complete the steps in the following sections. 
Create legacy Java Spring Boot application 
To create a legacy Java Spring Boot application, you first build a legacy Java 8, Spring Boot 2.3.x bookstore application, which you’ll modernize and migrate to AWS. Go back to Amazon Q Developer CLI and use natural language query to create the preceding application. Follow these steps: 
 
 You can use your own words or use the following prompt to generate the code. The prompt generates the sample payloads to test the application. Keep a copy of those payloads for later use. To understand more about best practices for prompt engineering, refer to Mastering Amazon Q Developer Part 1: Crafting Effective Prompts in the AWS DevOps &amp; Developer Productivity Blog. 
 
 
 You will bootstrap the current directory with a java 8 spring boot RESTful microservice application which provides an API. The microservice provides operations for storing, updating, deleting and finding book information. The supported attributes are isbn, book_title, author, price, and currency. The price attribute is numeric and everything else is String. The isbn attribute format needs to be validated as per standard ISBN code format. You can use regex for that. Store the book information in local cache. It should also provide an Actuator endpoint. The project should be built using Maven. Share example payloads to test the microservice now. Once I review and approve the payload proceed with bootstrapping.  
 
 
 Provide approval to generate the legacy application. 
 
 
 Approved. Go ahead. 
 
Amazon Q Developer CLI generates the working code with Java 8 using Spring Boot 2.3.x framework. 
 
 Explore the generated project files and validate the Java and Spring Boot versions. 
 Provide the following prompt to run the application. 
 
 
 Can you run the microservice? 
 
 
 Test the microservice using a REST API client or using curl command. You can also ask Amazon Q Developer CLI to test the application and fix errors, preparing a fully functional service! 
 After testing is complete, stop the microservice. Your legacy application is now ready to be modernized. 
 (Optional) Ask Amazon Q Developer CLI to generate a component and sequence diagram for the legacy application. 
 
Refer to the following video for a quick demo. 

 
  
 
 
Upgrade Java and Spring Boot versions 
Upgrade the legacy Java Spring Boot application that you created in the previous step using Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
As mentioned previously, if you’re using one of the supported integrated development environments (IDEs) and Java versions, you can use the /transform command within your IDE to perform this step. 
 
 Use your own words or the following prompt to update the legacy application. Amazon Q Developer performs required changes in both maven pom.xml and Java code to upgrade to Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.5.0. It builds the code after the upgrade. If the build fails, then Amazon Q Developer iteratively tries to fix the build by applying necessary code and configuration changes. 
 
 
 Can you update the microservice from Java 8 to Java 21? Also update the spring-boot version to version 3.5.0?   
 
 
 After the project upgrade is complete, validate the pom.xml for Java and Spring Boot versions. Explore the changes made to the Java code. The following example code from pom.xml validates the updated Java and Spring Boot versions: 
 
 
     &lt;properties&gt;
        &lt;java.version&gt;21&lt;/java.version&gt;
    &lt;/properties&gt;
…
    &lt;parent&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.5.0&lt;/version&gt;
        &lt;relativePath/&gt;
    &lt;/parent&gt; 
 
 
 Provide the following prompt to run the application: 
 
 
 Can you run the microservice? 
 
 
 Retest the microservice and make sure that it’s still working as expected. You can use Amazon Q Developer CLI to test, troubleshoot, and fix the upgraded application, if needed. 
 After testing is complete, stop the microservice. Your legacy application is now upgraded to Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.5.0. 
 
Refer to the following video to know more. 

 
  
 
 
Containerize the upgraded application 
Containerize the application so that the application can be run on both x86_64 and ARM64 hardware: 
 
 Use your own words or the following prompt to create docker image for the application Amazon Q Developer creates the Dockerfile for your application and builds it to create images that can be run on x86_64 and ARM64 systems. 
 
 
 Can you containerize this application? Create a Dockerfile, build the container image and tag with "eks-bookstore-java-microservice"? Run and test the endpoints. Make sure the container is built as a multi-architecture image supporting both x86_64 and ARM64.   
 
 
 Explore and validate the Dockerfile created by Amazon Q Developer for your application. 
 Provide the following prompt to run the application on your local system: 
 
 
 Can you run the docker image on my laptop? 
 
 
 Test the microservice using a REST API client or using curl command. When it’s done, stop the docker container using the following prompt: 
 
 
 Stop the container. 
 
Your application is now containerized and tested on the local system. The heavy lifting of the making the code and configuration changes, updating the dependency, and writing Dockerfile is done by Amazon Q Developer. 
Refer to the following video for a demo. 

 
  
 
 
Deploy the application on Amazon EKS 
Deploy the containerized application on Amazon EKS. To do so, create a new EKS cluster and use Helm Chart to deploy the application. Amazon Q Developer CLI uses Amazon EKS MCP server to perform some of these actions. Amazon Q Developer CLI uses the default profile unless instructed to use another. 
 
 Use your own words or the following prompt to push the docker image to an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository: 
 
 
 Build the Dockerfile and push this image to an Amazon ECR repository called "eks-bookstore-java-microservice" in the AWS account. Provide the image URL once this is complete.   
 
 
 Provide the following prompt to deploy the image into a new EKS cluster using Helm chart: 
 
 
 Create a new Amazon EKS cluster. Deploy the microservice to the EKS cluster using Helm chart. I want to test the microservice over the public Internet. Share the microservice URL to test once done.  
 
 
 Enter the following command in the Amazon Q chat session to check the application pods are running. Alternately, ask Amazon Q chat to get the pods using kubectl: 
 
 
 !kubectl get pods 
 
 
 Test the microservice again to make sure that the deployed application is working as expected. 
 
Your containerized application is now running successfully on the EKS cluster. This completes the migration and modernization of the legacy Java Spring Boot application. 
Refer to the following video for a demo. 

 
  
 
 
Introduce chaos 
In real-world complex applications, while Amazon Q Developer performs the heavy lifting of upgrading, containerizing, and deploying the application on AWS, you might encounter application-specific environmental issues. In this step, you’ll simulate an out-of-memory (OOM) issue by introducing chaos into the system. You can introduce the chaos using one of the below options: 
You can introduce the chaos using AWS Fault Injection Service EKS Pod actions or by following the below steps: 
 
 Apply a patch deployment to reduce memory allocation: 
 
 
 apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: bookstore-bookstore
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: bookstore
        env:
        - name: JAVA_OPTS
          value: "-Xms200m -Xmx200m -XX:+CrashOnOutOfMemoryError"
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            memory: "64Mi"
            cpu: "100m" 
 
 
 Introduce stress: 
 
 
 apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: stress-test
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: stress-test
        image: polinux/stress
        command: ["stress"]
        args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "350M", "--vm-hang", "0"]
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "400Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
          requests:
            memory: "200Mi"
            cpu: "200m"
        env:
        - name: TARGET_POD
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: spec.nodeName
      restartPolicy: Never 
 
Wait until the pods crashes with an OOM error. 
Refer to the following video for a demo. 

 
  
 
 
Troubleshoot and fix 
Troubleshoot the issue using Amazon Q Developer CLI with EKS MCP server: 
 
 Use your own words or the following prompt to start troubleshooting the application using Amazon Q Developer CLI. It might take multiple iterations to identify the root cause and potential fix. 
 
 
 I have used Helm chart to deploy the application on EKS cluster. But application is not running. Can you identify the root cause of this the issue and share the potential fix for the issue? 
 
 
 After you validate that Amazon Q Developer CLI can identify the root cause of the issue and suggest a potential solution, provide approval to let it fix the issue: 
 
 
 Please go ahead and fix. 
 
 
 Validate the application is running fine by checking the pod status and invoking the APIs using curl command or a REST API client. 
 
Modifications related to security in Amazon EKS are out of scope for this post. Follow the security best practices before moving into production. Using Amazon Q Developer, you can accelerate the migration and modernization journey, but as the owner of the code, you need to do the due diligence on the changes. 
Due to the inherent nondeterministic nature of the FMs, the responses of the Amazon Q Developer CLI might not be exactly same as those shown in the demo. You need to adjust the prompts accordingly. 
Refer to the following video for a demo. 

 
  
 
 
Clean up 
Properly decommissioning provisioned AWS resources is an important best practice to optimize costs and enhance security posture after concluding proofs of concept and demonstrations. Follow the steps to delete the resources created in your AWS account: 
 
 Use your own words or the following prompt to identify the resources that were created during this demonstration. 
 
 
 I have tested the application. It is time for clean-up. Can you list down the AWS resources that you created for this microservices? Do not delete anything, give me the list. You will delete only after I confirm. 
 
 
 Carefully validate whether Amazon Q Developer has correctly identified only the desired resources to be deleted and then provide approval. If in doubt, manually delete them. 
 
 
 Ok, please go ahead and delete. 
 
 
 Delete the .amazonq/mcp.json file from your workspace folder to remove MCP configuration for Amazon Q Developer CLI. 
 
Conclusion 
In this post, you learned how Amazon Q Developer CLI with Amazon EKS MCP server integration interprets natural language queries, automatically converts them into appropriate commands, and identifies the necessary tools for execution. You upgraded a legacy Java Spring Boot application, then containerized it to support deployment on multi-architectural computes. You deployed the application on Amazon EKS, introduced chaos, and resolved the issues using natural language queries. Using Amazon Q Developer CLI, you can improve your developer’s productivity many times over. We encourage you to explore additional use cases and share your feedback with us!
