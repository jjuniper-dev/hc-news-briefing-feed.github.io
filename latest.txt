‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs never been easier to be a conspiracy theorist
  The timing was eerie.



On November 21, 1963, Richard Hofstadter delivered the annual Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University. Hofstadter was a professor of American history at Columbia University who liked to use social psychology to explain political history, the better to defend liberalism from extremism on both sides. His new lecture was titled ‚ÄúThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.‚Äù&nbsp;



‚ÄúI call it the paranoid style,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúsimply because no other word adequately evokes the qualities of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.‚Äù



Then, barely 24 hours later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. This single, shattering event, and subsequent efforts to explain it, popularized a term for something that is clearly the subject of Hofstadter‚Äôs talk though it never actually figures in the text: ‚Äúconspiracy theory.‚Äù








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








Hofstadter‚Äôs lecture was later revised into what remains an essential essay, even after decades of scholarship on conspiracy theories, because it lays out, with both rigor and concision, a historical continuity of conspiracist politics. ‚ÄúThe paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent,‚Äù he writes, tracing the phenomenon back to the early years of the republic. Though each upsurge in conspiracy theories feels alarmingly novel‚Äînew narratives disseminated through new technologies on a new scale‚Äîthey all conform to a similar pattern. As Hofstadter demonstrated, the names may change, but the fundamental template remains the same.



His psychological reading of politics has been controversial, but it is psychology, rather than economics or other external circumstances, that best explains the flourishing of conspiracy theories. Subsequent research has indeed shown that we are prone to perceive intentionality and patterns where none exist‚Äîand that this helps us feel like a person of consequence. To identify and expose a secret plot is to feel heroic and gain the illusion of control over the bewildering mess of life.&nbsp;





Like many pioneering theories exposed to the cold light of hindsight, Hofstadter‚Äôs has flaws and blind spots. His key oversight was to downplay&nbsp; the paranoid style‚Äôs role in mainstream politics up to that point and underrate its potential to spread in the future.



In 1963, conspiracy theories were still a fringe phenomenon, not because they were inherently unusual but because they had limited reach and were stigmatized by people in power. Now that neither factor holds true, it is obvious how infectious they are. Hofstadter could not, of course, have imagined the information technologies that have become stitched into our lives, nor the fractured media ecosystem of the 21st century, both of which have allowed conspiracist thinking to reach more and more people‚Äîto morph, and to bloom like mold. And he could not have predicted that a serial conspiracy theorist would be elected president, twice, and that he would staff his second administration with fellow proponents of the paranoid style.&nbsp;



But Hofstadter‚Äôs concept of the paranoid style remains useful‚Äîand ever relevant‚Äîbecause it also describes a way of reading the world. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies or plots here or there in history, but they regard a ‚Äòvast‚Äô or ‚Äògigantic‚Äô conspiracy as the motive force in historical events. History is a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost transcendent power, and what is felt to be needed to defeat it is not the usual methods of political give-and-take, but an all-out crusade.‚Äù



Needless to say, this mystically unified version of history is not just untrue but impossible. It doesn‚Äôt make sense on any level. So why has it proved so alluring for so long‚Äîand why does it seem to be getting more popular every day?



What is a conspiracy theory, anyway?&nbsp;



The first person to define the ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù as a widespread phenomenon was the Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper, in his 1948 lecture ‚ÄúTowards a Rational Theory of Tradition.‚Äù He was not referring to a theory about an individual conspiracy. He was interested in ‚Äúthe conspiracy theory of society‚Äù: a particular way of interpreting the course of events.&nbsp;



He later defined it as ‚Äúthe view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.‚Äù



Take an unforeseen catastrophe that inspires fear, anger, and pain‚Äîa financial crash, a devastating fire, a terrorist attack, a war. The conventional historian will try to unpick a tangle of different factors, of which malice is only one, and one that may be less significant than dumb luck.



The conspiracist, however, will perceive only sinister calculation behind these terrible events‚Äîa fiendishly intricate plot conceived and executed to perfection. Intent is everything. Popper‚Äôs observation chimes with Hofstadter‚Äôs: ‚ÄúThe paranoid‚Äôs interpretation of history is ‚Ä¶ distinctly personal: decisive events are not taken as part of the stream of history, but as the consequences of someone‚Äôs will.‚Äù



A Culture of ConspiracyMichael BarkunUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 2013




According to Michael Barkun in the 2003 book A Culture of Conspiracy, the conspiracist interpretation of events rests on three assumptions: Everything is connected, everything is premeditated, and nothing is as it seems. Following that third law means that widely accepted and documented history is, by definition, suspect and alternative explanations, however outr√©, are more likely to be true. As Hannah Arendt wrote in The Origins of Totalitarianism, the purpose of conspiracy theories in 20th-century dictatorships ‚Äúwas always to reveal official history as a joke, to demonstrate a sphere of secret influences in which the visible, traceable, and known historical reality was only the outward fa√ßade erected explicitly to fool the people.‚Äù (Those dictators, of course, were conspirators themselves, projecting their own love of secret plots onto others.)




Still, it‚Äôs important to remember that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù can mean different things. Barkun describes three varieties, nesting like Russian dolls.&nbsp;



The ‚Äúevent conspiracy theory‚Äù concerns a specific, contained catastrophe, such as the Reichstag fire of 1933 or the origins of covid-19. These theories are relatively plausible, even if they can not be proved.&nbsp;



The ‚Äúsystemic conspiracy theory‚Äù is much more ambitious, purporting to explain numerous events as the poisonous fruit of a clandestine international plot. Far-fetched though they are, they do at least fixate on named groups, whether the Illuminati or the World Economic Forum.&nbsp;





It is increasingly clear that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy belief.




Finally, the ‚Äúsuperconspiracy theory‚Äù is that impossible fantasy in which history itself is a conspiracy, orchestrated by unseen forces of almost supernatural power and malevolence. The most extreme variants of QAnon posit such a universal conspiracy. It seeks to encompass and explain nothing less than the entire world.



These are very different genres of storytelling. If the first resembles a detective story, then the other two are more akin to fables. Yet one can morph into the other. Take the theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The first wave of amateur investigators created event conspiracy theories‚Äîrelatively self-contained plots with credible assassins such as Cubans or the Mafia.&nbsp;



But over time, event conspiracy theories have come to seem parochial. By the time of Oliver Stone‚Äôs 1991 movie JFK, once-popular plots had been eclipsed by elaborate fictions of gigantic long-running conspiracies in which the murder of the president was just one component. One of Stone‚Äôs primary sources was the journalist Jim Marrs, who went on to write books about the Freemasons and UFOs.&nbsp;



Why limit yourself to a laboriously researched hypothesis about a single event when one giant, dramatic plot can explain them all?&nbsp;



The theory of everything&nbsp;



In every systemic or superconspiracy theory, the world is corrupt and unjust and getting worse. An elite cabal of improbably powerful individuals, motivated by pure malignancy, is responsible for most of humanity‚Äôs misfortunes. Only through the revelation of hidden knowledge and the cracking of codes by a righteous minority can the malefactors be unmasked and defeated. The morality is as simplistic as the narrative is complex: It is a battle between good and evil.



Notice anything? This is not the language of democratic politics but that of myth and of religion. In fact, it is the fundamental message of the Book of Revelation. Conspiracist thinking can be seen as an offshoot, often but not always secularized, of apocalyptic Christianity, with its alluring web of prophecies, signs, and secrets and its promise of violent resolution. After studying several millenarian sects for his 1957 book The Pursuit of the Millennium, the historian Norman Cohn itemized some common traits, among them ‚Äúthe megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect, wholly good, abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph; the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers to the adversary; the refusal to accept the ineluctable limitations and imperfections of human experience.‚Äù



Popper similarly considered the conspiracy theory of society ‚Äúa typical result of the secularization of religious superstition,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúThe gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups ‚Ä¶ whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from.‚Äù&nbsp;



QAnon‚Äôs mutation from a conspiracy theory on an internet message board into a movement with the characteristics of a cult makes explicit the kinship between conspiracy theories and apocalyptic religion.



This way of thinking facilitates the creation of dehumanized scapegoats‚Äîone of the oldest and most consistent features of a conspiracy theory. During the Middle Ages and beyond, political and religious leaders routinely flung the name ‚ÄúAntichrist‚Äù at their opponents. During the Crusades, Christians falsely accused Europe‚Äôs Jewish communities of collaborating with Islam or poisoning wells and put them to the sword. Witch-hunters implicated tens of thousands of innocent women in a supposed satanic conspiracy that was said to explain everything from illness to crop failure. ‚ÄúConspiracy theories are, in the end, not so much an explanation of events as they are an effort to assign blame,‚Äù writes Anna Merlan in the 2019 book Republic of Lies.



Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to PowerAnna MerlanMETROPOLITAN PUBLISHERS, 2019




But the systemic conspiracy theory as we know it‚Äîthat is, the ostensibly secular variety‚Äîwas established three centuries later, with remarkable speed. Some horrified opponents of the French Revolution could not accept that such an upheaval could be simply a popular revolt and needed to attribute it to sinister, unseen forces. They settled on the Illuminati, a Bavarian secret society of Enlightenment intellectuals influenced in part by the rituals and hierarchy of Freemasonry.&nbsp;



The group was founded by a young law professor named Adam Weishaupt, who used the alias Brother Spartacus. In reality, the Illuminati were few in number, fractious, powerless, and, by the time of the revolution in 1789, defunct. But in the imaginations of two influential writers who published ‚Äúexpos√©s‚Äù of the Illuminati in 1797‚ÄîScotland‚Äôs John Robison and France‚Äôs Augustin Barruel‚Äîthey were everywhere. Each man erected a wobbling tower of wild supposition and feverish nonsense on a platform of plausible claims and verifiable facts. Robison alleged that the revolution was merely part of ‚Äúone great and wicked project‚Äù whose ultimate aim was to ‚Äúabolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



The Illuminati‚Äôs bogeyman status faded during the 19th century, but the core narrative persisted and proceeded to underpin the notorious hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, first published in a Russian newspaper in 1903. The document‚Äôs anonymous author reinvented antisemitism by grafting it onto the story of the one big plot and positing Jews as the secret rulers of the world. In this account, the Elders orchestrate every war, recession, and so on in order to destabilize the world to the point where they can impose tyranny.&nbsp;



You might ask why, if they have such world-bending power already, they would require a dictatorship. You might also wonder how one group could be responsible for both communism and monopoly capitalism, anarchism and democracy, the theory of evolution, and much more besides. But the vast, self-contradicting incoherence of the plot is what made it impossible to disprove. Nothing was ruled out, so every development could potentially be taken as evidence of the Elders at work.



In 1921, the Protocols were exposed as what the London Times called a ‚Äúclumsy forgery,‚Äù plagiarized from two obscure 19th-century novels, yet they remained the key text of European antisemitism‚Äîessentially ‚Äútrue‚Äù despite being demonstrably false. ‚ÄúI believe in the inner, but not the factual, truth of the Protocols,‚Äù said Joseph Goebbels, who would become Hitler‚Äôs minister of propaganda. In Mein Kampf, Hitler claimed that efforts to debunk the Protocols were actually ‚Äúevidence in favor of their authenticity.‚Äù He alleged that Jews, if not stopped, would ‚Äúone day devour the other nations and become lords of the earth.‚Äù Popper and Hofstadter both used the Holocaust as an example of what happens when a conspiracy theorist gains power and makes the paranoid style a governing principle.



STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN




The prominent role of Jewish Bolsheviks like Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Russian Revolution of 1917 enabled a merger of antisemitism and anticommunism that survived the fascist era. Cold War red-baiters such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society assigned to communists uncanny degrees of malice and ubiquity, far beyond the real threat of Soviet espionage. In fact, they presented this view as the only logical one. McCarthy claimed that a string of national security setbacks could be explained only if George C. Marshall, the secretary of defense and former secretary of state, was literally a Soviet agent. ‚ÄúHow can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster?‚Äù he asked in 1951. ‚ÄúThis must be the product of a great conspiracy so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.‚Äù



This continuity between antisemitism, anticommunism, and 18th-century paranoia about secret societies isn‚Äôt hard to see. General Francisco Franco, Spain‚Äôs right-wing dictator, claimed to be fighting a ‚ÄúJudeo-Masonic-Bolshevik‚Äù conspiracy. The Nazis persecuted Freemasons alongside Jews and communists. Nesta Webster, the British fascist sympathizer who laundered the Protocols through the British press, revived interest in Robison and Barruel‚Äôs books about the Illuminati, which the pro-Nazi Baptist preacher Gerald Winrod then promoted in the US. Even Winston Churchill was briefly persuaded by Webster‚Äôs work, citing it in his claims of a ‚Äúworld-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization ‚Ä¶ from the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to the days of Karl Marx.‚Äù



To follow the chain further, Webster and Winrod‚Äôs stew of anticommunism, antisemitism, and anti-Illuminati conspiracy theories influenced the John Birch Society, whose publications would light a fire decades later under the Infowars founder Alex Jones, perhaps the most consequential conspiracy theorist of the early 21st century.¬†



The villains behind the one big plot might be the Illuminati, the Elders of Zion, the communists, or the New World Order, but they are always essentially the same people, aspiring to officially dominate a world that they already secretly control. The names can be swapped around without much difficulty. While Winrod maintained that ‚Äúthe real conspirators behind the Illuminati were Jews,‚Äù the anticommunist William Guy Carr conversely argued that antisemitic paranoia ‚Äúplays right into the hands of the Illuminati.‚Äù These days, it might be the World Economic Forum or George Soros; liberal internationalists with aspirations to change the world are easily cast as the new Illuminati, working toward establishing one world government.



Finding connection



The main reason that conspiracy theorists have lost interest in the relatively hard work of micro-conspiracies in favor of grander schemes is that it has become much easier to draw lines between objectively unrelated people and events. Information technology is, after all, also misinformation technology. That‚Äôs nothing new.&nbsp;



The witch craze could not have traveled as far or lasted as long without the printing press. Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches), a 1486 screed by the German witch-hunter Heinrich Kramer, became the best-selling witch-hunter‚Äôs handbook, going through 28 editions by 1600. Similarly, it was the books and pamphlets ‚Äúexposing‚Äù the Illuminati that allowed those ideas to spread everywhere following the French Revolution. And in the early 20th century, the introduction of the radio facilitated fascist propaganda. During the 1930s, the Nazi-sympathizing Catholic priest and radio host Charles Coughlin broadcast his antisemitic conspiracy theories to tens of millions of Americans on dozens of stations.&nbsp;



The internet has, of course, vastly accelerated and magnified the spread of conspiracy theories. It is hard to recall now, but in the early days it was sweetly assumed that the internet would improve the world by democratizing access to information. While this initial idealism survives in doughty enclaves such as Wikipedia, most of us vastly underestimated the human appetite for false information that confirms the consumer‚Äôs biases.



Politicians, too, were slow to recognize the corrosive power of free-flowing conspiracy theories. For a long time, the more fantastical assertions of McCarthy and the Birchers were kept at arm‚Äôs length from the political mainstream, but that distance began to diminish rapidly during the 1990s, as right-wing activists built a cottage industry of outrageous claims about Bill and Hillary Clinton to advance the idea that they were not just corrupt or dishonest but actively evil and even satanic. This became an article of faith in the information ecosystem of internet message boards and talk radio, which expanded over time to include Fox News, blogs, and social media. So when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016, a significant portion of the American public saw a monster at the heart of an organized crime ring whose activities included human trafficking and murder.



Nobody could make the same mistake about misinformation today. One could hardly design a more fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories than social media. The algorithms of YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and X, which operate on the principle that rage is engaging, have turned into radicalization machines. When these platforms took off during the second half of the 2010s, they offered a seamless system in which people were able to come across exciting new information, share it, connect it to other strands of misinformation, and weave them into self-contained, self-affirming communities, all without leaving the house.



It‚Äôs not hard to see how the problem will continue to grow as AI burrows ever deeper into our everyday lives. Elon Musk has tinkered with the AI chatbot Grok to produce information that conforms to his personal beliefs rather than to actual facts. This outcome does not even have to be intentional. Chatbots have been shown to validate and intensify some users‚Äô beliefs, even if they‚Äôre rooted in paranoia or hubris. If you believe that you‚Äôre the hero in an epic battle between good and evil, then your chatbot is inclined to agree with you.



It‚Äôs all this digital noise that has brought about the virtual collapse of the event conspiracy theory. The industry produced by the JFK assassination may have been pseudo-scholarship, but at least researchers went through the motions of scrutinizing documents, gathering evidence, and putting forward a somewhat consistent hypothesis. However misguided the conclusions, that kind of conspiracy theory required hard work and commitment.&nbsp;



CARL MYDANS/THE LIFE PICTURE COLLECTION/SHUTTERSTOCK




Today‚Äôs online conspiracy theorists, by contrast, are shamelessly sloppy. Events such as the attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in October 2022, or the murders of Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in June 2025, or even more recently the killing of Charlie Kirk, have inspired theories overnight, which then evaporate just as quickly. The point of such theories, if they even merit that label, is not to seek the truth but to defame political opponents and turn victims into villains.



Before he even ran for office, Trump was notorious for promoting false stories about Barack Obama‚Äôs birthplace or vaccine safety. Heir to Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater, and the John Birch Society, he is the lurid incarnation of the paranoid style. He routinely damns his opponents as ‚Äúevil‚Äù or ‚Äúvery bad people‚Äù and speaks of America‚Äôs future in apocalyptic terms. It is no surprise, then, that every member of the administration must subscribe to Trump‚Äôs false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, or that celebrity conspiracy theorists are now in charge of national intelligence, public health, and the FBI. Former Democrats who hold such roles, like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have entered Trump‚Äôs orbit through the gateway of conspiracy theories. They illustrate how this mindset can create counterintuitive alliances that collapse conventional political distinctions and scramble traditional notions of right and left.&nbsp;



The antidemocratic implications of what‚Äôs happening today are obvious. ‚ÄúSince what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to the finish,‚Äù Hofstadter wrote. ‚ÄúNothing but complete victory will do.‚Äù&nbsp;



Meeting the moment



It‚Äôs easy to feel helpless in the face of this epistemic chaos. Because one other foundational feature of religious prophecy is that it can be disproved without being discredited: Perhaps the world does not come to an end on the predicted day, but that great day will still come. The prophet is never wrong‚Äîhe is just not proven right yet.&nbsp;



The same flexibility is enjoyed by systemic conspiracy theories. The plotters never actually succeed, nor are they ever decisively exposed, yet the theory remains intact. Recently, claims that covid-19 was either exaggerated or wholly fabricated in order to crush civil liberties did not wither away once lockdown restrictions were lifted. Surely the so-called ‚Äúplandemic‚Äù was a complete disaster? No matter. This type of conspiracy theory does not have to make sense.



Scholars who have attempted to methodically repudiate conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks or the JFK assassination have found that even once all the supporting pillars have been knocked away, the edifice still stands. It is increasingly clear that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy belief‚Äîas Hofstadter suggested, a worldview buttressed with numerous cognitive biases and impregnable to refutation. As Goebbels implied, the ‚Äúfactual truth‚Äù pales in comparison to the ‚Äúinner truth,‚Äù which is whatever somebody believes it be.



But at the very least, what we can do is identify the entirely different realities constructed by believers and recognize and internalize their common roots, tropes, and motives.&nbsp;



Those different realities, after all, have proved remarkably consistent in shape if not in their details. What we saw then, we see now. The Illuminati were Enlightenment idealists whose liberal agenda to ‚Äúdispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice,‚Äù in Weishaupt‚Äôs words, was demonized as wicked and destructive. If they could be shown to have fomented the French Revolution, then the whole revolution was a sham. Similarly, today‚Äôs radical right recasts every plank of progressive politics as an anti-American conspiracy. The far-right Great Replacement Theory, for instance, posits that immigration policy is a calculated effort by elites to supplant the native population with outsiders. This all flows directly from what thinkers such as Hofstadter, Popper, and Arendt diagnosed more than 60 years ago.&nbsp;



What is dangerously novel, at least in democracies, is conspiracy theories‚Äô ubiquity, reach, and power to affect the lives of ordinary citizens. So understanding the paranoid style better equips us to counteract it in our daily existence. At minimum, this knowledge empowers us to spot the flaws and biases in our own thinking and stop ourselves from tumbling down dangerous rabbit holes.&nbsp;



The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other EssaysRichard HofstadterVINTAGE BOOKS, 1967




On November 18, 1961, President Kennedy‚Äîalmost exactly two years before Hofstadter‚Äôs lecture and his own assassination‚Äîoffered his own definition of the paranoid style in a speech to the Democratic Party of California. ‚ÄúThere have always been those on the fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt times these fanatics have achieved a temporary success among those who lack the will or the wisdom to face unpleasant facts or unsolved problems. But in time the basic good sense and stability of the great American consensus has always prevailed.‚Äù&nbsp;



We can only hope that the consensus begins to see the rolling chaos and naked aggression of Trump‚Äôs two administrations as weighty evidence against the conspiracy theory of society. The notion that any group could successfully direct the larger mess of this moment in the world, let alone the course of history for decades, undetected, is palpably absurd.

‚Ä¢ Can ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù really predict the future?
  According to internet listicles, the animated sitcom The Simpsons has predicted the future anywhere from 17 to 55 times.&nbsp;



‚ÄúAs you know, we‚Äôve inherited quite a budget crunch from President Trump,‚Äù the newly sworn-in President Lisa Simpson declared way back in 2000, 17 years before the real estate mogul was inaugurated as the 45th leader of the United States. Earlier, in 1993, an episode of the show featured the ‚ÄúOsaka flu,‚Äù which some felt was eerily prescient of the coronavirus pandemic. And‚Äîsomehow!‚ÄîSimpsons writers just knew that the US Olympic curling team would beat Sweden eight whole years before they did it.

The 16th-century seer Nostradamus made 942 predictions. To date, there have been some 800 episodes of The Simpsons. How does it feel to be a showrunner turned soothsayer? What‚Äôs it like when the world combs your jokes for prophecies and thinks you knew about 9/11 four years before it happened?&nbsp;








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








Al Jean has worked on The Simpsons on and off since 1989; he is the cartoon‚Äôs longest-serving showrunner. Here, he reflects on the conspiracy theories that have sprung from these apparent prophecies.&nbsp;



When did you first start hearing rumblings about The Simpsons having predicted the future?



It definitely got huge when Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 after we ‚Äúpredicted‚Äù it in an episode from 2000. The original pitch for the line was Johnny Depp and that was in for a while, but it was decided that it wasn‚Äôt as funny as Trump.&nbsp;



What people don‚Äôt remember is that in the year 2000, it wasn‚Äôt such a crazy name to pick, because Trump was talking about running as a Reform Party candidate. So, like a lot of our ‚Äúpredictions,‚Äù it‚Äôs an educated guess. I won‚Äôt comment on whether it‚Äôs a good thing that it happened, but I will say that it‚Äôs not the most illogical person you could have picked for that joke. And we did say that following him was Lisa, and now that he‚Äôs been elected again, we could still have Lisa next time‚Äîthat‚Äôs my hope!&nbsp;



How did it make you feel that people thought you were a prophet?&nbsp;



Again, apart from the election‚Äôs impact on the free world, I would say that we were amused that we had said something that came true. Then we made a short video called ‚ÄúTrumptastic Voyage‚Äù in 2015 that predicted he would run in 2016, 2020, 2024, and 2028, so we‚Äôre three-quarters of the way through that arduous prediction.









But I like people thinking that I know something about the future. It‚Äôs a good reputation to have. You only need half a dozen things that were either on target or even uncanny to be considered an oracle. Or maybe we‚Äôre from the future‚ÄîI‚Äôll let you decide!&nbsp;



Why do you think people are so drawn to the idea that The Simpsons is prophetic?&nbsp;



Maybe it slightly satisfies a yearning people have for meaning, certainly when life is now so random.



Would you say that most of your predictions have logical explanations?&nbsp;



It‚Äôs cherry-picking‚Äîthere are 35 years of material. How many of the things that we said came true versus how many of the many things we said did not come true?&nbsp;



In 2014, we predicted Germany would win the World Cup in Brazil. It‚Äôs because we wanted a joke where the Brazilians were sad and they were singing a sad version of the ‚ÄúOl√©, ol√©‚Äù song. So we had to think about who would be likely to win if Brazil lost, and Germany was the number two, so they did win, but it wasn‚Äôt the craziest prediction. In the same episode, we predicted that FIFA would be corrupt, which is a very easy prediction! So a lot of them fall under that category.&nbsp;



In one scene I wrote, Marge holds a book called Curious George and the Ebola Virus‚Äîpeople go, ‚ÄúOh my God! He predicted that!‚Äù Well, Ebola existed when I wrote the joke. I‚Äôd seen a movie about it called Outbreak. It‚Äôs like predicting the Black Death.&nbsp;



But have any of your so-called ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù made even you pause?&nbsp;



There are a couple of really bizarre coincidences. There was a brochure in a New York episode [which aired in 1997] that said ‚ÄúNew York, $9‚Äù next to a picture of the trade towers looking like an 11. That was nuts. It still sends chills down me. The writer of that episode, Ian Maxtone-Graham, was nonplussed. He really couldn‚Äôt believe it.&nbsp;



THE SIMPSONS  &#038; ¬© 20TH TELEVISION




It‚Äôs not like we would‚Äôve made that knowing what was going to come, which we didn‚Äôt. And people have advanced conspiracy theories that we‚Äôre all Ivy League writers who knew ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs preposterous stuff that people say. There‚Äôs also a thing people do that we don‚Äôt really love, which is they fake predictions. So after something happens, they‚Äôll concoct a Simpsons frame, and it‚Äôs not something that ever aired. [Editor‚Äôs note: People faked Simpsons screenshots seeming to predict the 2024 Baltimore bridge collapse and the 2019 Notre-Dame fire. Images from the real ‚ÄúOsaka flu‚Äù episode were also edited to include the word ‚Äúcoronavirus.‚Äù]&nbsp;



How does that make you feel? Is it frustrating?



It shows you how you can really convince people of something that‚Äôs not the case. Our small denial doesn‚Äôt get as much attention.&nbsp;



As far as internet conspiracies go, where would you rate the idea that The Simpsons can predict the future?&nbsp;



I hope it‚Äôs harmless. I think it‚Äôs really lodged in the internet very well. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs disappearing anytime soon. I‚Äôm sure for the rest of my life I‚Äôll be hearing about what a group of psychics and seers I was part of. If we really could predict that well, we‚Äôd all be retired from betting on football. Although, advice to readers: Don‚Äôt bet on football.&nbsp;



THE SIMPSONS  &#038; ¬© 20TH TELEVISION




Still, it is a tiny part of a trend that is alarming, which is people being unable to distinguish fact from fiction. And I have that trouble too. You read something, and your natural inclination has always been, ‚ÄúWell, I read it‚Äîit‚Äôs true.‚Äù And you have to really be skeptical about that.&nbsp;



Can I ask you to predict a solution to all of this?



I think my only solution is: Look at your phone less and read more books.

‚Ä¢ How conspiracy theories infiltrated the doctor‚Äôs office
  As anyone who has googled their symptoms and convinced themselves that they‚Äôve got a brain tumor will attest, the internet makes it very easy to self-(mis)diagnose your health problems. And although social media and other digital forums can be a lifeline for some people looking for a diagnosis or community, when that information is wrong, it can put their well-being and even lives in danger.



Unfortunately, this modern impulse to ‚Äúdo your own research‚Äù became even more pronounced during the coronavirus pandemic.








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








We asked a number of health-care professionals about how this shifting landscape is changing their profession. They told us that they are being forced to adapt how they treat patients. It‚Äôs a wide range of experiences: Some say patients tell them they just want more information about certain treatments because they‚Äôre concerned about how effective they are. Others hear that their patients just don‚Äôt trust the powers that be. Still others say patients are rejecting evidence-based medicine altogether in favor of alternative theories they‚Äôve come across online.¬†




These are their stories, in their own words.

The physician trying to set shared goals&nbsp;







David Scales



Internal medicine hospitalist and assistant professor of medicine, Weill Cornell Medical CollegeNew York City

















Every one of my colleagues has stories about patients who have been rejective of care, or had very peculiar perspectives on what their care should be. Sometimes that‚Äôs driven by religion. But I think what has changed is people, not necessarily with a religious standpoint, having very fixed beliefs that are sometimes‚Äîbased on all the evidence that we have‚Äîin contradiction with their health goals. And that is a very challenging situation.&nbsp;



I once treated a patient with a connective tissue disease called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. While there‚Äôs no doubt that the illness exists, there‚Äôs a lot of doubt and uncertainty over which symptoms can be attributed to Ehlers-Danlos. This means it can fall into what social scientists call a ‚Äúcontested illness.‚Äù&nbsp;



Contested illnesses used to be causes for arguably fringe movements, but they have become much more prominent since the rise of social media in the mid-2010s. Patients often search for information that resonates with their experience.&nbsp;



This patient was very hesitant about various treatments, and it was clear she was getting her information from, I would say, suspect sources. She‚Äôd been following people online who were not necessarily trustworthy, so I sat down with her and we looked them up on Quackwatch, a site that lists health myths and misconduct.&nbsp;



&#8220;She was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources.&#8221;



She was still accepting of treatment, and was extremely knowledgeable, and had done a lot of her own research, but she struggled to tell the difference between good and bad sources and fixed beliefs that overemphasize particular things‚Äîlike what symptoms might be attributable to other stuff.



Physicians have the tools to work with patients who are struggling with these challenges. The first is motivational interviewing, a counseling technique that was developed for people with substance-use disorders. It‚Äôs a nonjudgmental approach that uses open-ended questions to draw out people‚Äôs motivations, and to find where there‚Äôs a mismatch between their behaviors and their beliefs. It‚Äôs highly effective in treating people who are vaccine-hesitant.



Another is an approach called shared decision-making. First we work out what the patient‚Äôs goals are and then figure out a way to align those with what we know about the evidence-based way to treat them. It‚Äôs something we use for end-of-life care, too.



What‚Äôs concerning to me is that it seems as though there‚Äôs a dynamic of patients coming in with a fixed belief of how to diagnose their illness, how their symptoms should be treated, and how to treat it in a way that‚Äôs completely divorced from the kinds of medicine you‚Äôd find in textbooks‚Äîand that the same dynamic is starting to extend to other illnesses, too.







The therapist committed to being there when the conspiracy fever breaks&nbsp;







Damien Stewart



PsychologistWarsaw, Poland







Before covid, I hadn‚Äôt really had any clients bring up conspiracy theories into my practice. But once the pandemic began, they went from being fun or harmless to something dangerous.In my experience, vaccines were the topic where I first really started to see some militancy‚Äîpeople who were looking down the barrel of losing their jobs because they wouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated. At one point, I had an out-and-out conspiracy theorist say to me, ‚ÄúI might as well wear a yellow star like the Jews during the Holocaust, because I won‚Äôt get vaccinated.‚Äù&nbsp;



I felt pure anger, and I reached a point in my therapeutic journey I didn‚Äôt know would ever occur‚ÄîI‚Äôd found that I had a line that could be crossed by a client that I could not tolerate. I spoke in a very direct manner he probably wasn‚Äôt used to and challenged his conspiracy theory. He got very angry and hung up the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;



It made me figure out how I was going to deal with this in future, and to develop an approach‚Äîwhich was to not challenge the conspiracy theory, but to gently talk through it, to provide alternative points of view and ask questions. I try to find the therapeutic value in the information, in the conversations we‚Äôre having. My belief is and evidence seems to show that people believe in conspiracy theories because there‚Äôs something wrong in their life that is inexplicable, and they need something to explain what‚Äôs happening to them. And even if I have no belief or agreement whatsoever in what they‚Äôre saying, I think I need to sit here and have this conversation, because one day this person might snap out of it, and I need to be here when that happens.



As a psychologist, you have to remember that these people who believe in these things are extremely vulnerable. So my anger around these conspiracy theories has changed from being directed toward the deliverer‚Äîthe person sitting in front of me saying these things‚Äîto the people driving the theories.







The emergency room doctor trying to get patients to reconnect with the evidence







Luis Aguilar Montalvan



Attending emergency medicine physician&nbsp;Queens, New York







The emergency department is essentially the pulse of what is happening in society. That‚Äôs what really attracted me to it. And I think the job of the emergency doctor, particularly within shifting political views or belief in Western medicine, is to try to reconnect with someone. To just create the experience that you need to prime someone to hopefully reconsider their relationship with this evidence-based medicine.



When I was working in the pediatrics emergency department a few years ago, we saw a resurgence of diseases we thought we had eradicated, like measles. I typically framed it by saying to the child‚Äôs caregiver: ‚ÄúThis is a disease we typically use vaccines for, and it can prevent it in the majority of people.‚Äù&nbsp;



&#8220;The doctor is now more like a consultant or a customer service provider than the authority. &#8230; The power dynamic has changed.&#8221;



The sentiment among my adult patients who are reluctant to get vaccinated or take certain medications seems to be from a mistrust of the government or ‚ÄúThe System‚Äù rather than from anything Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says directly, for example. I‚Äôm definitely seeing more patients these days asking me what they can take to manage a condition or pain that‚Äôs not medication. I tell them that the knowledge I have is based on science, and explain the medications I‚Äôd typically give other people in their situation. I try to give them autonomy while reintroducing the idea of sticking with the evidence, and for the most part they‚Äôre appreciative and courteous.



The role of doctor has changed in recent years‚Äîthere‚Äôs been a cultural change. My understanding is that back in the day, what the doctor said, the patient did. Some doctors used to shame parents who hadn‚Äôt vaccinated their kids. Now we‚Äôre shifting away from that, and the doctor is now more like a consultant or a customer service provider than the authority. I think that could be because we‚Äôve seen a lot of bad actors in medicine, so the power dynamic has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think if we had a more unified approach at a national level, if they had an actual unified and transparent relationship with the population, that would set us up right. But I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôve ever had it.

The psychologist who supported severely mentally ill patients through the pandemic&nbsp;







Michelle Sallee



Psychologist, board certified in serious mental illness psychologyOakland, California







I‚Äôm a clinical psychologist who only works with people who have been in the hospital three or more times in the last 12 months. I do both individual therapy and a lot of group work, and several years ago during the pandemic, I wrote a 10-week program for patients about how to cope with sheltering in place, following safety guidelines, and their concerns about vaccines.



My groups were very structured around evidence-based practice, and I had rules for the groups. First, I would tell people that the goal was not to talk them out of their conspiracy theory; my goal was not to talk them into a vaccination. My goal was to provide a safe place for them to be able to talk about things that were terrifying to them. We wanted to reduce anxiety, depression, thoughts of suicide, and the need for psychiatric hospitalizations.¬†



Half of the group was pro‚Äìpublic health requirements, and their paranoia and fear for safety was around people who don‚Äôt get vaccinated; the other half might have been strongly opposed to anyone other than themselves deciding they need a vaccination or a mask. Both sides were fearing for their lives‚Äîbut from each other.



I wanted to make sure everybody felt heard, and it was really important to be able to talk about what they believed‚Äîlike, some people felt like the government was trying to track us and even kill us‚Äîwithout any judgment from other people. My theory is that if you allow people to talk freely about what&#8217;s on their mind without blocking them with your own opinions or judgment, they will find their way eventually. And a lot of times that works.&nbsp;



People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory or their paranoia has been stuck on it for a long time because they&#8217;re always fighting with people about it, everyone&#8217;s telling them that this is not true. So we would just have an open discussion about these things.&nbsp;



&#8220;People have been stuck on their conspiracy theory for a long time because they&#8217;re always fighting with people about it, everyone&#8217;s telling them that this is not true.&#8221;



I ran the program four times for a total of 27 people, and the thing that I remember the most was how respectful and tolerant and empathic, but still honest about their feelings and opinions, everybody was. At the end of the program, most participants reported a decrease in pandemic-related stress. Half reported a decrease in general perceived stress, and half reported no change.



I‚Äôd say that the rate of how much vaccines are talked about now is significantly lower, and covid doesn‚Äôt really come up anymore. But other medical illnesses come up‚Äîpatients saying, ‚ÄúMy doctor said I need to get this surgery, but I know who they‚Äôre working for.‚Äù Everybody has their concerns, but when a person with psychosis has concerns, it becomes delusional, paranoid, and psychotic.



I‚Äôd like to see more providers be given more training around severe mental illness. These are not just people who just need to go to the hospital to get remedicated for a couple of days. There‚Äôs a whole life that needs to get looked at here, and they deserve that. I‚Äôd like to see more group settings with a combination of psychoeducation, evidence-based research, skills training, and process, because the research says that‚Äôs the combination that‚Äôs really important.

The epidemiologist rethinking how to bridge differences in culture and community&nbsp;







John Wright



Clinician and epidemiologistBradford, United Kingdom







I work in Bradford, the fifth-biggest city in the UK. It has a big South Asian population and high levels of deprivation. Before covid, I‚Äôd say there was growing awareness about conspiracies. But during the pandemic, I think that lockdown, isolation, fear of this unknown virus, and then the uncertainty about the future came together in a perfect storm to highlight people‚Äôs latent attraction to alternative hypotheses and conspiracies‚Äîit was fertile ground. I‚Äôve been a National Health Service doctor for almost 40 years, and until recently, the NHS had a great reputation, with great trust, and great public support. The pandemic was the first time that I started seeing that erode.



It wasn‚Äôt just conspiracies about vaccines or new drugs, either‚Äîit was also an undermining of trust in public institutions. I remember an older woman who had come into the emergency department with covid. She was very unwell, but she just wouldn‚Äôt go into hospital despite all our efforts, because there were conspiracies going around that we were killing patients in hospital. So she went home, and I don‚Äôt know what happened to her.



The other big change in recent years has been social media and social networks that have obviously amplified and accelerated alternative theories and conspiracies. That‚Äôs been the tinder that‚Äôs allowed the wildfires to spread with these sort of conspiracy theories. In Bradford, particularly among ethnic minority communities, there‚Äôs been stronger links between them‚Äîallowing this to spread quicker‚Äîbut also a more structural distrust.&nbsp;



Vaccination rates have fallen since the pandemic, and we‚Äôre seeing lower uptake of the meningitis and HPV vaccines in schools among South Asian families. Ultimately, this needs a bigger societal approach than individual clinicians putting needles in arms. We started a project called Born in Bradford in 2007 that‚Äôs following more than 13,000 families, including around 20,000 teenagers as they grow up. One of the biggest focuses for us is how they use social media and how it links to their mental health, so we‚Äôre asking them to donate their digital media to us so we can examine it in confidence. We‚Äôre hoping it could allow us to explore conspiracies and influences.



The challenge for the next generation of resident doctors and clinicians is: How do we encourage health literacy in young people about what‚Äôs right and what‚Äôs wrong without being paternalistic? We also need to get better at engaging with people as health advocates to counter some of the online narratives. The NHS website can‚Äôt compete with how engaging content on TikTok is.







The pediatrician who worries about the confusing public narrative on vaccines







Jessica Weisz



PediatricianWashington, DC







I‚Äôm an outpatient pediatrician, so I do a lot of preventative care, checkups, and sick visits, and treating coughs and colds‚Äîthose sorts of things. I‚Äôve had specific training in how to support families in clinical decision-making related to vaccines, and every family wants what‚Äôs best for their child, and so supporting them is part of my job.



I don‚Äôt see specific articulation of conspiracy theories, but I do think there‚Äôs more questions about vaccines in conversations I‚Äôve not typically had to have before. I‚Äôve found that parents and caregivers do ask general questions about the risks and benefits of vaccines. We just try to reiterate that vaccines have been studied, that they are intentionally scheduled to protect an immature immune system when it‚Äôs the most vulnerable, and that we want everyone to be safe, healthy, and strong. That‚Äôs how we can provide protection.



&#8220;I think what‚Äôs confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated.&#8221;



I feel that the narrative in the public space is unfairly confusing to families when over 90% of families still want their kids to be vaccinated. The families who are not as interested in that, or have questions‚Äîit typically takes multiple conversations to support that family in their decision-making. It‚Äôs very rarely one conversation.



I think what‚Äôs confusing is that distress is being sowed in headlines when most patients, families, and caregivers are motivated and want to be vaccinated. For example, some of the headlines around recent changes the CDC are making make it sound like they‚Äôre making a huge clinical change, when it‚Äôs actually not a huge change from what people are typically doing. In my standard clinical practice, we don‚Äôt give the combined MMRV vaccine to children under four years old, and that‚Äôs been standard practice in all of the places I‚Äôve worked on the Eastern Seaboard. [Editor‚Äôs note: In early October, the CDC updated its recommendation that young children receive the varicella vaccine separately from the combined vaccine for measles, mumps, and rubella. Many practitioners, including Weisz, already offer the shots separately.]



If you look at public surveys, pediatricians are still the most trusted [among health-care providers], and I do live in a jurisdiction with pretty strong policy about school-based vaccination. I think that people are getting information from multiple sources, but at the end of the day, in terms of both the national rates and also what I see in clinical practice, we really are seeing most families wanting vaccines.
‚Ä¢ Why it‚Äôs so hard to bust the weather control conspiracy theory
  It was October 2024, and Hurricane Helene had just devastated the US Southeast. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia found an abstract target on which to pin the blame: ‚ÄúYes they can control the weather,‚Äù she posted on X. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù&nbsp;



There was no word on who ‚Äúthey‚Äù were, but maybe it was better that way.&nbsp;



She was repeating what‚Äôs by now a pretty familiar and popular conspiracy theory: that shadowy forces are out there, wielding unknown technology to control the weather and wreak havoc on their supposed enemies. This claim, fundamentally preposterous from a scientific standpoint, has grown louder and more common in recent years. It pops up over and over when extreme weather strikes: in Dubai in April 2024, in Australia in July 2022, in the US after California floods and hurricanes like Helene and Milton. In the UK, conspiracy theorists claimed that the government had fixed the weather to be sunny and rain-free during the first covid lockdown in March 2020. Most recently, the theories spread again when disastrous floods hit central Texas this past July. The idea has even inspired some antigovernment extremists to threaten and try to destroy weather radar towers.&nbsp;








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








But here‚Äôs the thing: While Greene and other believers are not correct, this conspiracy theory‚Äîlike so many others‚Äîholds a kernel of much more modest truth behind the grandiose claims.¬†



Sure, there is no current way for humans to control the weather. We can‚Äôt cause major floods or redirect hurricanes or other powerful storm systems, simply because the energy involved is far too great for humans to alter significantly.&nbsp;



But there are ways we can modify the weather. The key difference is the scale of what is possible.&nbsp;



The most common weather modification practice is called cloud seeding, and it involves injecting small amounts of salts or other materials into clouds with the goal of juicing levels of rain or snow. This is typically done in dry areas that lack regular precipitation. Research shows that it can in fact work, though advances in technology reveal that its impact is modest‚Äîcoaxing maybe 5% to 10% more moisture out of otherwise stubborn clouds.



But the fact that humans can influence weather at all gives conspiracy theorists a foothold in the truth. Add to this a spotty history of actual efforts by governments and militaries to control major storms, as well as other emerging but not-yet-deployed-at-any-scale technologies that aim to address climate change ‚Ä¶ and you can see where things get confusing.¬†



So while more sweeping claims of weather control are ultimately ridiculous from a scientific standpoint, they can‚Äôt be dismissed as entirely stupid.



This all helped make the conspiracy theories swirling after the recent Texas floods particularly loud and powerful. Just days earlier, 100 miles away from the epicenter of the floods, in a town called Runge, the cloud-seeding company Rainmaker had flown a single-engine plane and released about 70 grams of silver iodide into some clouds; a modest drizzle of less than half a centimeter of rain followed. But once the company saw a storm front in the forecast, it suspended its work; there was no need to seed with rain already on the way.





‚ÄúWe conducted an operation on July 2, totally within the scope of what we were regulatorily permitted to do,‚Äù Augustus Doricko, Rainmaker‚Äôs founder and CEO, recently told me. Still, when as much as 20 inches of rain fell soon afterward not too far away, and more than 100 people died, the conspiracy theory machine whirred into action.&nbsp;



As Doricko told the Washington Post in the tragedy‚Äôs aftermath, he and his company faced ‚Äúnonstop pandemonium‚Äù on social media; eventually someone even posted photos from outside Rainmaker‚Äôs office, along with its address. Doricko told me a few factors played into the pile-on, including a lack of familiarity with the specifics of cloud seeding, as well as what he called ‚Äúdeliberately inflammatory messaging from politicians.‚Äù Indeed, theories about Rainmaker and cloud seeding spread online via prominent figures including Greene and former national security advisor Mike Flynn.&nbsp;



Unfortunately, all this is happening at the same time as the warming climate is making heavy rainfall and the floods that accompany it more and more likely. ‚ÄúThese events will become more frequent,‚Äù says Emily Yeh, a professor of geography at the University of Colorado who has examined approaches and reactions to weather modification around the world. ‚ÄúThere is a large, vocal group of people who are willing to believe anything but climate change as the reason for Texas floods, or hurricanes.‚Äù



Worsening extremes, increasing weather modification activity, improving technology, a sometimes shady track record‚Äîthe conditions are perfect for an otherwise niche conspiracy theory to spread to anyone desperate for tidy explanations of increasingly disastrous events.



Here, we break down just what‚Äôs possible and what isn‚Äôt‚Äîand address some of the more colorful reasons why people may believe things that go far beyond the facts.&nbsp;



What we can do with the weather‚Äîand who is doing it




The basic concepts behind cloud seeding have been around for about 80 years, and government interest in the topic goes back even longer than that.&nbsp;



The primary practice involves using planes, drones, or generators on the ground to inject tiny particles of stuff, usually silver iodide, into existing clouds. The particles act as nuclei around which moisture can build up, forming ice crystals that can get heavy enough to fall out of the cloud as snow or rain.




‚ÄúWeather modification is an old field; starting in the 1940s there was a lot of excitement,‚Äù says David Delene, a research professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of North Dakota and an expert on cloud seeding. In a US Senate report from 1952 to establish a committee to study weather modification, authors noted that a small amount of extra rain could ‚Äúproduce electric power worth hundreds of thousands of dollars‚Äù and ‚Äúgreatly increase crop yields.‚Äù It also cited potential uses like ‚Äúreducing soil erosion,‚Äù ‚Äúbreaking up hurricanes,‚Äù and even ‚Äúcutting holes in clouds so that aircraft can operate.‚Äù&nbsp;



LIBRARY OF CONGRESS





But, as Delene adds, ‚Äúthat excitement ‚Ä¶ was not realized.‚Äù



Through the 1980s, extensive research often funded or conducted by Washington yielded a much better understanding of atmospheric science and cloud physics, though it proved extremely difficult to actually demonstrate the efficacy of the technology itself. In other words, scientists learned the basic principles behind cloud seeding, and understood on a theoretical level that it should work‚Äîbut it was hard to tell how big an impact it was having on rainfall.




There is huge variability between one cloud and another, one storm system and another, one mountain or valley and another; for decades, the tools available to researchers did not really allow for firm conclusions on exactly how much extra moisture, if any, they were getting out of any given operation. Interest in the practice died down to a low hum by the 1990s.



But over the past couple of decades, the early excitement has returned.



Cloud seeding can enhance levels of rain and snow&nbsp;



While the core technology has largely stayed the same, several projects launched in the US and abroad starting in the 2000s have combined statistical modeling with new and improved aircraft-based measurements, ground-based radar, and more to provide better answers on what results are actually achievable when seeding clouds.



‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve identified unequivocally that we can indeed modify the cloud,‚Äù says Jeff French, an associate professor and head of the University of Wyoming‚Äôs Department of Atmospheric Science, who has worked for years on the topic. But even as scientists have come to largely agree that the practice can have an impact on precipitation, they also largely recognize that the impact probably has some fairly modest upper limits‚Äîfar short of massive water surges.&nbsp;



‚ÄúThere is absolutely no evidence that cloud seeding can modify a cloud to the extent that would be needed to cause a flood,‚Äù French says. Floods require a few factors, he adds‚Äîa system with plenty of moisture available that stays localized to a certain spot for an extended period. ‚ÄúAll of these things which cloud seeding has zero effect on,‚Äù he says.&nbsp;



The technology simply operates on a different level. ‚ÄúCloud seeding really is looking at making an inefficient system a little bit more efficient,‚Äù French says.&nbsp;



As Delene puts it: ‚ÄúOriginally [researchers] thought, well, we could, you know, do 50%, 100% increases in precipitation,‚Äù but ‚ÄúI think if you do a good program you‚Äôre not going to get more than a 10% increase.‚Äù&nbsp;



Asked for his take on a theoretical limit, French was hesitant‚Äî‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm ready to stick my neck out‚Äù‚Äîbut agreed on ‚Äúmaybe 10-ish percent‚Äù as a reasonable guess.



Another cloud seeding expert, Katja Friedrich from the University of Colorado‚ÄìBoulder, says that any grander potential would be obvious by this point: We wouldn‚Äôt have ‚Äúspent the last 100 years debating‚Äîwithin the scientific community‚Äîif cloud seeding works,‚Äù she writes in an email. ‚ÄúIt would have been easy to separate the signal (from cloud seeding) from the noise (natural precipitation).‚Äù



It can also (probably) suppress precipitation



Sometimes cloud seeding is used not to boost rain and snow but rather to try to reduce its severity‚Äîor, more specifically, to change the size of individual rain droplets or hailstones.¬†



One of the most prominent examples has been in parts of Canada, where hailstorms can be devastating; a 2024 event in Calgary, for instance, was the country‚Äôs second-most-expensive disaster ever, with over $2 billion in damages.¬†



Insurance companies in Alberta have been working together for nearly three decades on a cloud seeding program that‚Äôs aimed at reducing some of that damage. In these cases, the silver iodide or other particles are meant to act essentially as competition for other ‚Äúembryos‚Äù inside the cloud, increasing the total number of hailstones and thus reducing each individual stone‚Äôs average size.&nbsp;



Smaller hailstones means less damage when they reach the ground. The insurance companies‚Äîwhich continue to pay for the program‚Äîsay losses have been cut by 50% since the program started, though scientists aren‚Äôt quite as confident in its overall success. A 2023 study published in Atmospheric Research examined 10 years of cloud seeding efforts in the province and found that the practice did appear to reduce potential for damage in about 60% of seeded storms‚Äîwhile in others, it had no effect or was even associated with increased hail (though the authors said this could have been due to natural variation).



Similar techniques are also sometimes deployed to try to improve the daily forecast just a bit. During the 2008 Olympics, for instance, China engaged in a form of cloud seeding aimed at reducing rainfall. As MIT Technology Review detailed back then, officials with the Beijing Weather Modification Office planned to use a liquid-nitrogen-based coolant that could increase the number of water droplets in a cloud while reducing their size; this can get droplets to stay aloft a little longer instead of falling out of the cloud. Though it is tough to prove that it definitively would have rained without the effort, the targeted opening ceremony did stay dry.



So, where is this happening?&nbsp;



The United Nations‚Äô World Meteorological Organization says that some form of weather modification is taking place in ‚Äúmore than 50 countries‚Äù and that ‚Äúdemand for these weather modification activities is increasing steadily due to the incidence of droughts and other calamities.‚Äù



The biggest user of cloud-seeding tech is arguably China. Following the work around the Olympics, the country announced a huge expansion of its weather modification program in 2020, claiming it would eventually run operations for agricultural relief and other functions, including hail suppression, over an area about the size of India and Algeria combined. Since then, China has occasionally announced bits of progress‚Äîincluding updates to weather modification aircraft and the first use of drones for artificial snow enhancement. Overall, it spends billions on the practice, with more to come.







Elsewhere, desert countries have taken an interest. In 2024, Saudi Arabia announced an expanded research program on cloud seeding‚ÄîDelene, of the University of North Dakota, was part of a team that conducted experiments in various parts of that country in late 2023. Its neighbor the United Arab Emirates began ‚Äúrain enhancement‚Äù activities back in 1990; this program too has faced outcry, especially after more than a typical year‚Äôs worth of rain fell in a single day in 2024, causing massive flooding. (Bloomberg recently published a story about persistent questions regarding the country‚Äôs cloud seeding program; in response to the story, French wrote in an email that the ‚Äúbest scientific understanding is still that cloud seeding CANNOT lead to these types of events.‚Äù Other experts we asked agreed.)&nbsp;



In the US, a 2024 Government Accountability Office report on cloud seeding said that at least nine states have active programs. These are sometimes run directly by the state and sometimes contracted out through nonprofits like the South Texas Weather Modification Association to private companies, including Doricko‚Äôs Rainmaker and North Dakota‚Äìbased Weather Modification. In August, Doricko told me that Rainmaker had grown to 76 employees since it launched in 2023. It now runs cloud seeding operations in Utah, Idaho, Oregon, California, and Texas, as well as forecasting services in New Mexico and Arizona. And in an answer that may further fuel the conspiracy fire, he added they are also operating in one Middle Eastern country; when I asked which one, he‚Äôd only say, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt tell you.‚Äù



What we cannot do



The versions of weather modification that the conspiracy theorists envision most often‚Äîsignificantly altering monsoons or hurricanes or making the skies clear and sunny for weeks at a time‚Äîhave so far proved impossible to carry out. But that‚Äôs not necessarily for lack of trying.



The US government attempted to alter a hurricane in 1947 as part of a program dubbed Project Cirrus. In collaboration with GE, government scientists seeded clouds with pellets of dry ice, the idea being that the falling pellets could induce supercooled liquid in the clouds to crystallize into ice. After they did this, the storm took a sharp left turn and struck the area around Savannah, Georgia. This was a significant moment for budding conspiracy theories, since a GE scientist who had been working with the government said he was ‚Äú99% sure‚Äù the cyclone swerved because of their work. Other experts disagreed and showed that such storm trajectories are, in reality, perfectly possible without intervention. Perhaps unsurprisingly, public outrage and threats of lawsuits followed.



It took some time for the hubbub to die down, after which several US government agencies continued‚Äîunsuccessfully‚Äîtrying to alter and weaken hurricanes with a long-running cloud seeding program called Project Stormfury. Around the same time, the US military joined the fray with Operation Popeye, essentially trying to harness weather as a weapon in the Vietnam War‚Äîengaging in cloud seeding efforts over Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with an eye toward increasing monsoon rains and bogging down the enemy. Though it was never really clear whether these efforts worked, the Nixon administration tried to deny them, going so far as to lie to the public and even to congressional committees.







More recently and less menacingly, there have been experiments with Dyn-O-Gel‚Äîa Florida company‚Äôs super-absorbent powder, intended to be dropped into storm clouds to sop up their moisture. In the early 2000s, the company carried out experiments with the stuff in thunderstorms, and it had grand plans to use it to weaken tropical cyclones. But according to one former NOAA scientist, you would need to drop almost 38,000 tons of it, requiring nearly 380 individual plane trips, in and around even a relatively small cyclone‚Äôs eyewall to really affect the storm‚Äôs strength. And then you would have to do that again an hour and a half later, and so on. Reality tends to get in the way of the biggest weather modification ideas.



Beyond trying to control storms, there are some other potential weather modification technologies out there that are either just getting started or have never taken off. Swiss researchers have tried to use powerful lasers to induce cloud formation, for example; in Australia, where climate change is imperiling the Great Barrier Reef, artificial clouds created when ship-based nozzles spray moisture into the sky have been used to try to protect the vital ecosystem. In each case, the efforts remain small, localized, and not remotely close to achieving the kinds of control the conspiracy theorists allege.



What is not weather modification‚Äîbut gets lumped in with it



Further worsening weather control conspiracies is that there is a tendency to conflate cloud seeding and other promising weather modification research with concepts such as chemtrails‚Äîa full-on conspiracist fever dream about innocuous condensation trails left by jets‚Äîand solar geoengineering, a theoretical stopgap to cool the planet that has been subject to much discussion and modeling research but has never been deployed in any large-scale way.



One controversial form of solar geoengineering, known as stratospheric aerosol injection, would involve having high-altitude jets drop tiny aerosol particles‚Äîsulfur dioxide, most likely‚Äîinto the stratosphere to act essentially as tiny mirrors. They would reflect a small amount of sunlight back into space, leaving less energy to reach the ground and contribute to warming. To date, attempts to launch physical experiments in this space have been shouted down, and only tiny‚Äîthough still controversial‚Äîcommercial efforts have taken place.&nbsp;





One can see why it gets lumped in with cloud seeding: bits of stuff, dumped into the sky, with the aim of altering what happens down below. But the aims are entirely separate;¬†geoengineering would alter the global average temperature rather than having measurable effects on momentary cloudbursts or hailstorms. Some research has suggested that the practice could alter monsoon patterns, a significant issue given their importance to much of the world‚Äôs agriculture, but it remains a fundamentally different practice from cloud seeding.



Still, the political conversation around supposed weather control often reflects this confusion. Greene, for instance, introduced a bill in July called the Clear Skies Act, which would ban all weather modification and geoengineering activities. (Greene‚Äôs congressional office did not respond to a request for comment.) And last year, Tennessee became the first state to enact a law to prohibit the ‚Äúintentional injection, release, or dispersion, by any means, of chemicals, chemical compounds, substances, or apparatus ‚Ä¶ into the atmosphere with the express purpose of affecting temperature, weather, or the intensity of the sunlight.‚Äù Florida followed suit, with Governor Ron DeSantis signing SB 56 into law in June of this year for the same stated purpose.



Also this year, lawmakers in more than 20 other states have also proposed some version of a ban on weather modification, often lumping it in with geoengineering, even though caution on the latter is more widely accepted or endorsed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a conspiracy theory,‚Äù one Pennsylvania lawmaker who cosponsored a similar bill told NBC News. ‚ÄúAll you have to do is look up.‚Äù



Oddly enough, as Yeh of the University of Colorado points out, the places where bans have passed are states where weather modification isn‚Äôt really happening. ‚ÄúIn a way, it‚Äôs easy for them to ban it, because, you know, nothing actually has to be done,‚Äù she says. In general, neither Florida nor Tennessee‚Äînor any other part of the Southeast‚Äîneeds any help finding rain. Basically, all weather modification activity in the US happens in the drier areas west of the Mississippi.&nbsp;



Finding a culprit



Doricko told me that in the wake of the Texas disaster, he has seen more people become willing to learn about the true capabilities of cloud seeding and move past the more sinister theories about it.&nbsp;



I asked him, though, about some of his company‚Äôs flashier branding: Until recently, visitors to the Rainmaker website were greeted right up top with the slogan ‚ÄúMaking Earth Habitable.‚Äù Might this level of hype contribute to public misunderstanding or fear?&nbsp;



He said he is indeed aware that Earth is, currently, habitable, and called the slogan a ‚Äútongue-in-cheek, deliberately provocative statement.‚Äù Still, in contrast to the academics who seem more comfortable acknowledging weather modification‚Äôs limits, he has continued to tout its revolutionary potential. ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt produce more water, then a lot of the Earth will become less habitable,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy producing more water via cloud seeding, we‚Äôre helping to conserve the ecosystems that do currently exist, that are at risk of collapse.‚Äù&nbsp;



While other experts cited that 10% figure as a likely upper limit of cloud seeding‚Äôs effectiveness, Doricko said they could eventually approach 20%, though that might be years away. ‚ÄúIs it literally magic? Like, can I snap my fingers and turn the Sahara green? No,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut can it help make a greener, verdant, and abundant world? Yeah, absolutely.‚Äù&nbsp;







It‚Äôs not all that hard to see why people still cling to magical thinking here. The changing climate is, after all, offering up what‚Äôs essentially weaponized weather, only with a much broader and long-term mechanism behind it. There is no single sinister agency or company with its finger on the trigger, though it can be tempting to look for one; rather, we just have an atmosphere capable of holding more moisture and dropping it onto ill-prepared communities, and many of the people in power are doing little to mitigate the impacts.



‚ÄúGovernments are not doing a good job of responding to the climate crisis; they are often captured by fossil-fuel interests, which drive policy, and they can be slow and ineffective when responding to disasters,‚Äù Naomi Smith, a lecturer in sociology at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia who has written about conspiracy theories and weather events, writes in an email. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to hold all this complexity, and conspiracy theorizing is one way of making it intelligible and understandable.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



‚ÄúConspiracy theories give us a ‚Äòbig bad‚Äô to point the finger at, someone to blame and a place to put our feelings of anger, despair, and grief,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much less satisfying to yell at the weather, or to engage in the sustained collective action we actually need to tackle climate change.‚Äù



The sinister ‚Äúthey‚Äù in Greene‚Äôs accusations is, in other words, a far easier target than the real culprit.&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Chatbots are surprisingly effective at debunking conspiracy theories
  It‚Äôs become a truism that facts alone don‚Äôt change people‚Äôs minds. Perhaps nowhere is this more clear than when it comes to conspiracy theories: Many people believe that you can‚Äôt talk conspiracists out of their beliefs.&nbsp;



But that‚Äôs not necessarily true. It turns out that many conspiracy believers do respond to evidence and arguments‚Äîinformation that is now easy to deliver in the form of a tailored conversation with an AI chatbot.



In research we published in the journal Science this year, we had over 2,000 conspiracy believers engage in a roughly eight-minute conversation with DebunkBot, a model we built on top of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4 Turbo (the most up-to-date GPT model at that time). Participants began by writing out, in their own words, a conspiracy theory that they believed and the evidence that made the theory compelling to them. Then we instructed the AI model to persuade the user to stop believing in that conspiracy and adopt a less conspiratorial view of the world. A three-round back-and-forth text chat with the AI model (lasting 8.4 minutes on average) led to a 20% decrease in participants‚Äô confidence in the belief, and about one in four participants‚Äîall of whom believed the conspiracy theory beforehand‚Äîindicated that they did not believe it after the conversation. This effect held true for both classic conspiracies (think the JFK assassination or the moon landing hoax) and more contemporary politically charged ones (like those related to the 2020 election and covid-19).








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








This is good news, given the outsize role that unfounded conspiracy theories play in today‚Äôs political landscape. So while there are widespread and legitimate concerns that generative AI is a potent tool for spreading disinformation, our work shows that it can also be part of the solution.&nbsp;



Even people who began the conversation absolutely certain that their conspiracy was true, or who indicated that it was highly important to their personal worldview, showed marked decreases in belief. Remarkably, the effects were very durable; we followed up with participants two months later and saw just as big a reduction in conspiracy belief as we did immediately after the conversations.&nbsp;



Our experiments indicate that many believers are relatively rational but misinformed, and getting them timely, accurate facts can have a big impact. Conspiracy theories can make sense to reasonable people who have simply never heard clear, non-conspiratorial explanations for the events they‚Äôre fixated on. This may seem surprising. But many conspiratorial claims, while wrong, seem reasonable on the surface and require specialized, esoteric knowledge to evaluate and debunk.&nbsp;





For example, 9/11 deniers often point to the claim that jet fuel doesn‚Äôt burn hot enough to melt steel as evidence that airplanes were not responsible for bringing down the Twin Towers‚Äîbut the chatbot responds by pointing out that although this is true, the American Institute of Steel Construction says jet fuel does burn hot enough to reduce the strength of steel by over 50%, which is more than enough to cause such towers to collapse.&nbsp;



Although we have greater access to factual information than ever before, it is extremely difficult to search that vast corpus of knowledge efficiently. Finding the truth that way requires knowing what to google‚Äîor who to listen to‚Äîand being sufficiently motivated to seek out conflicting information. There are large time and skill barriers to conducting such a search every time we hear a new claim, and so it‚Äôs easy to take conspiratorial content you stumble upon at face value. And most would-be debunkers at the Thanksgiving table make elementary mistakes that AI avoids: Do you know the melting point and tensile strength of steel offhand? And when your relative calls you an idiot while trying to correct you, are you able to maintain your composure?&nbsp;



With enough effort, humans would almost certainly be able to research and deliver facts like the AI in our experiments. And in a follow-up experiment, we found that the AI debunking was just as effective if we told participants they were talking to an expert rather than an AI. So it‚Äôs not that the debunking effect is AI-specific. Generally speaking, facts and evidence delivered by humans would also work. But it would require a lot of time and concentration for a human to come up with those facts. Generative AI can do the cognitive labor of fact-checking and rebutting conspiracy claims much more efficiently.&nbsp;



In another large follow-up experiment, we found that what drove the debunking effect was specifically the facts and evidence the model provided: Factors like letting people know the chatbot was going to try to talk them out of their beliefs didn‚Äôt reduce its efficacy, whereas telling the model to try to persuade its chat partner without using facts and evidence totally eliminated the effect.&nbsp;



Although the foibles and hallucinations of these models are well documented, our results suggest that debunking efforts are widespread enough on the internet to keep the conspiracy-focused conversations roughly accurate. When we hired a professional fact-checker to evaluate GPT-4‚Äôs claims, they found that over 99% of the claims were rated as true (and not politically biased). Also, in the few cases where participants named conspiracies that turned out to be true (like MK Ultra, the CIA‚Äôs human experimentation program from the 1950s), the AI chatbot confirmed their accurate belief rather than erroneously talking them out of it.



To date, largely by necessity, interventions to combat conspiracy theorizing have been mainly prophylactic‚Äîaiming to prevent people from going down the rabbit hole rather than trying to pull them back out. Now, thanks to advances in generative AI, we have a tool that can change conspiracists‚Äô minds using evidence.&nbsp;



Bots prompted to debunk conspiracy theories could be deployed on social media platforms to engage with those who share conspiratorial content‚Äîincluding other AI chatbots that spread conspiracies. Google could also link debunking AI models to search engines to provide factual answers to conspiracy-related queries. And instead of arguing with your conspiratorial uncle over the dinner table, you could just pass him your phone and have him talk to AI.&nbsp;



Of course, there are much deeper implications here for how we as humans make sense of the world around us. It is widely argued that we now live in a ‚Äúpost-truth‚Äù world, where polarization and politics have eclipsed facts and evidence. By that account, our passions trump truth, logic-based reasoning is pass√©, and the only way to effectively change people‚Äôs minds is via psychological tactics like presenting compelling personal narratives or changing perceptions of the social norm. If so, the typical, discourse-based work of living together in a democracy is fruitless.



But facts aren‚Äôt dead. Our findings about conspiracy theories are the latest‚Äîand perhaps most extreme‚Äîin an emerging body of research demonstrating the persuasive power of facts and evidence. For example, while it was once believed that correcting falsehoods that aligns with one‚Äôs politics would just cause people to dig in and believe them even more, this idea of a ‚Äúbackfire‚Äù has itself been debunked: Many studies consistently find that corrections and warning labels reduce belief in, and sharing of, falsehoods‚Äîeven among those who most distrust the fact-checkers making the corrections. Similarly, evidence-based arguments can change partisans‚Äô minds on political issues, even when they are actively reminded that the argument goes against their party leader‚Äôs position. And simply reminding people to think about whether content is accurate before they share it can substantially reduce the spread of misinformation.&nbsp;



And if facts aren‚Äôt dead, then there‚Äôs hope for democracy‚Äîthough this arguably requires a consensus set of facts from which rival factions can work. There is indeed widespread partisan disagreement on basic facts, and a disturbing level of belief in conspiracy theories. Yet this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean our minds are inescapably warped by our politics and identities. When faced with evidence‚Äîeven inconvenient or uncomfortable evidence‚Äîmany people do shift their thinking in response. And so if it‚Äôs possible to disseminate accurate information widely enough, perhaps with the help of AI, we may be able to reestablish the factual common ground that is missing from society today.

‚Ä¢ Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies
  Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.

First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.
In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second &#8212; the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.
These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.
&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;
The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.
Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.

From a website‚Äôs perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes ‚Äî such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.
And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.
&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH
Riley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.
&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;
To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:
AUPROXIES_PROXY¬† 66,097
RAYOBYTE_PROXY¬† ¬† 43,894
OXYLABS_PROXY¬† ¬†43,008
WEBSHARE_PROXY¬† ¬†39,800
IPROYAL_PROXY¬† ¬† 32,723
PROXYCHEAP_PROXY¬† ¬† 26,368
IPIDEA_PROXY¬† ¬† 26,202
MYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY¬† 25,287
HYPE_PROXY¬† ¬† 18,185
MASSIVE_PROXY¬† ¬† 17,152
Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;
LUMINATI_PROXY¬† ¬† 11,856,421
NETNUT_PROXY¬† ¬† 10,982,458
ABCPROXY_PROXY¬† ¬† 9,294,419
OXYLABS_PROXY¬† ¬† ¬†6,754,790
IPIDEA_PROXY¬† ¬† ¬†3,209,313
EARNFM_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,659,913

INFATICA_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,335,194
IPROYAL_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,032,027
YILU_PROXY¬† ¬† 1,549,155
Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.
&#8220;We don‚Äôt systematically track other providers‚Äô figures, and we‚Äôre not aware of any instances of 10√ó or 100√ó growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.
Bright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.
&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said Rony Shalit, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;
&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;
HK NETWORK
Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.
Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.
Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.
&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;
Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.
Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.
&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;
Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.
Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.¬†Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy¬†(#10) as IPidea.
Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;HK Network.&#8221;
&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;

Those apps include a range of low-cost and &#8220;free&#8221; virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user&#8217;s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.
&#8220;They have all this bandwidth to offload,&#8221; Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. &#8220;And they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.&#8221;
One of IPidea&#8217;s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company&#8217;s servers were massively hacked.
That 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.

DATA SCRAPING FOR AI
In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.
&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.
Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.
&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;
Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.
&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.
Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.
Cloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;pay-per-crawl&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.
On October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.
&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google‚Äôs search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;
Denas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.
&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs‚Äô position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;
As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.
In July, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;
A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME
Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;Forky,&#8221; and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.
A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.
For one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, &#8220;chief hacking officer&#8221; for the security intelligence company Seralys.
Caturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.
But even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.
&#8220;The bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.&#8221;
Caturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.
The domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. &#8220;Dirt Jumper&#8221;).
Domaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David &#8220;Abdilo&#8221; Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.

‚Ä¢ Hosting NVIDIA speech NIM models on Amazon SageMaker AI: Parakeet ASR
  This post was written with NVIDIA and the authors would like to thank Adi Margolin, Eliuth Triana, and Maryam Motamedi for their collaboration. 
Organizations today face the challenge of processing large volumes of audio data‚Äìfrom customer calls and meeting recordings to podcasts and voice messages‚Äìto unlock valuable insights. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a critical first step in this process, converting speech to text so that further analysis can be performed. However, running ASR at scale is computationally intensive and can be expensive. This is where asynchronous inference on Amazon SageMaker AI comes in. By deploying state-of-the-art ASR models (like NVIDIA Parakeet models) on SageMaker AI with asynchronous endpoints, you can handle large audio files and batch workloads efficiently. With asynchronous inference, long-running requests can be processed in the background (with results delivered later); it also supports auto-scaling to zero when there‚Äôs no work and handles spikes in demand without blocking other jobs. 
In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to host the NVIDIA Parakeet ASR model on SageMaker AI and integrate it into an asynchronous pipeline for scalable audio processing. We‚Äôll also highlight the benefits of Parakeet‚Äôs architecture and the NVIDIA Riva toolkit for speech AI, and discuss how to use NVIDIA NIM for deployment on AWS. 
NVIDIA speech AI technologies: Parakeet ASR and Riva Framework 
NVIDIA offers a comprehensive suite of speech AI technologies, combining high-performance models with efficient deployment solutions. At its core, the Parakeet ASR model family represents state-of-the-art speech recognition capabilities, achieving industry-leading accuracy with low word error rates (WERs) . The model‚Äôs architecture uses the Fast Conformer encoder with the CTC or transducer decoder, enabling 2.4√ó faster processing than standard Conformers while maintaining accuracy. 
NVIDIA speech NIM is a collection of GPU-accelerated microservices for building customizable speech AI applications. NVIDIA Speech models deliver accurate transcription accuracy and natural, expressive voices in over 36 languages‚Äìideal for customer service, contact centers, accessibility, and global enterprise workflows. Developers can fine-tune and customize models for specific languages, accents, domains, and vocabularies, supporting accuracy and brand voice alignment. 
Seamless integration with LLMs and the NVIDIA Nemo Retriever make NVIDIA models ideal for agentic AI applications, helping your organization stand out with more secure, high-performing, voice AI. The NIM framework delivers these services as containerized solutions, making deployment straightforward through Docker containers that include the necessary dependencies and optimizations. 
This combination of high-performance models and deployment tools provides organizations with a complete solution for implementing speech recognition at scale. 
Solution overview 
The architecture illustrated in the diagram showcases a comprehensive asynchronous inference pipeline designed specifically for ASR and summarization workloads. The solution provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective processing pipeline. 
 
Architecture components 
The architecture consists of five key components working together to create an efficient audio processing pipeline. At its core, the SageMaker AI asynchronous endpoint hosts the Parakeet ASR model with auto scaling capabilities that can scale to zero when idle for cost optimization. 
 
 The data ingestion process begins when audio files are uploaded to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), triggering AWS Lambda functions that process metadata and initiate the workflow. 
 For event processing, the SageMaker endpoint automatically sends out Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) success and failure notifications through separate queues, enabling proper handling of transcriptions. 
 Successfully transcribed content on Amazon S3 moves to Amazon Bedrock LLMs for intelligent summarization and additional processing like classification and insights extraction. 
 Finally, a comprehensive tracking system using Amazon DynamoDB stores workflow status and metadata, enabling real-time monitoring and analytics of the entire pipeline. 
 
Detailed implementation walkthrough 
In this section, we will provide the detailed walkthrough of the solution implementation. 
SageMaker asynchronous endpoint prerequisites 
To run the example notebooks, you need an AWS account with an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with least-privilege permissions to manage resources created. For details, refer to Create an AWS account. You might need to request a service quota increase for the corresponding SageMaker async hosting instances. In this example, we need one ml.g5.xlarge SageMaker async hosting instance and a ml.g5.xlarge SageMaker notebook instance. You can also choose a different integrated development environment (IDE), but make sure the environment contains GPU compute resources for local testing. 
SageMaker asynchronous endpoint configuration 
When you deploy a custom model like Parakeet, SageMaker has a couple of options: 
 
 Use a NIM container provided by NVIDIA 
 Use a large model inference (LMI) container 
 Use a prebuilt PyTorch container 
 
We‚Äôll provide examples for all three approaches. 
Using an NVIDIA NIM container 
NVIDIA NIM provides a streamlined approach to deploying optimized AI models through containerized solutions. Our implementation takes this concept further by creating a unified SageMaker AI endpoint that intelligently routes between HTTP and gRPC protocols to help maximize both performance and capabilities while simplifying the deployment process. 
Innovative dual-protocol architecture 
The key innovation is the combined HTTP + gRPC architecture that exposes a single SageMaker AI endpoint with intelligent routing capabilities. This design addresses the common challenge of choosing between protocol efficiency and feature completeness by automatically selecting the optimal transport method. The HTTP route is optimized for simple transcription tasks with files under 5MB, providing faster processing and lower latency for common use cases. Meanwhile, the gRPC route supports larger files (SageMaker AI real-time endpoints support a max payload of 25MB) and advanced features like speaker diarization with precise word-level timing information. The system‚Äôs auto-routing functionality analyzes incoming requests to determine file size and requested features, then automatically selects the most appropriate protocol without requiring manual configuration. For applications that need explicit control, the endpoint also supports forced routing through /invocations/http for simple transcription or /invocations/grpc when speaker diarization is required. This flexibility allows both automated optimization and fine-grained control based on specific application requirements. 
Advanced speech recognition and speaker diarization capabilities 
The NIM container enables a comprehensive audio processing pipeline that seamlessly combines speech recognition with speaker identification through the NVIDIA Riva integrated capabilities. The container handles audio preprocessing, including format conversion and segmentation, while ASR and speaker diarization processes run concurrently on the same audio stream. Results are automatically aligned using overlapping time segments, with each transcribed segment receiving appropriate speaker labels (for example, Speaker_0, Speaker_1). The inference handler processes audio files through the complete pipeline, initializing both ASR and speaker diarization services, running them in parallel, and aligning transcription segments with speaker labels. The output includes the full transcription, timestamped segments with speaker attribution, confidence scores, and total speaker count in a structured JSON format. 
Implementation and deployment 
The implementation extends NVIDIA parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us NIM container as the foundation, adding a Python aiohttp server that seamlessly manages the complete NIM lifecycle by automatically starting and monitoring the service. The server handles protocol adaptation by translating SageMaker inference requests to appropriate NIM APIs, implements the intelligent routing logic that analyzes request characteristics, and provides comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages and fallback mechanisms for robust production deployment. The containerized solution streamlines deployment through standard Docker and AWS CLI commands, featuring a pre-configured Docker file with the necessary dependencies and optimizations. The system accepts multiple input formats including multipart form-data (recommended for maximum compatibility), JSON with base64 encoding for simple integration scenarios, and raw binary uploads for direct audio processing. 
For detailed implementation instructions and working examples, teams can reference the complete implementation and deployment notebook in the AWS samples repository, which provides comprehensive guidance on deploying Parakeet ASR with NIM on SageMaker AI using the bring your own container (BYOC) approach. For organizations with specific architectural preferences, separate HTTP-only and gRPC-only implementations are also available, providing simpler deployment models for teams with well-defined use cases while the combined implementation offers maximum flexibility and automatic optimization. 
AWS customers can deploy these models either as production-grade NVIDIA NIM containers directly from SageMaker Marketplace or JumpStart, or open source NVIDIA models available on Hugging Face, which can be deployed through custom containers on SageMaker or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). This allows organizations to choose between fully managed, enterprise-tier endpoints with auto-scaling and security, or flexible open-source development for research or constrained use cases. 
Using an AWS LMI container 
LMI containers are designed to simplify hosting large models on AWS. These containers include optimized inference engines like vLLM, FasterTransformer, or TensorRT-LLM that can automatically handle things like model parallelism, quantization, and batching for large models. The LMI container is essentially a pre-configured Docker image that runs an inference server (for example a Python server with these optimizations) and allows you to specify model parameters by using environment variables. 
To use the LMI container for Parakeet, we would typically: 
 
 Choose the appropriate LMI image: AWS provides different LMI images for different frameworks. For Parakeet , we might use the DJLServing image for efficient inference. Alternatively, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (which Riva uses) is an option if we package the model in ONNX or TensorRT format. 
 Specify the model configuration: With LMI, we often provide a model_id (if pulling from Hugging Face Hub) or a path to our model, along with configuration for how to load it (number of GPUs, tensor parallel degree, quantization bits). The container then downloads the model and initializes it with the specified settings. We can also download our own model files from Amazon S3 instead of using the Hub. 
 Define the inference handler: The LMI container might require a small handler script or configuration to tell it how to process requests. For ASR, this might involve reading the audio input, passing it to the model, and returning text. 
 
AWS LMI containers deliver high performance and scalability through advanced optimization techniques, including continuous batching, tensor parallelism, and state-of-the-art quantization methods. LMI containers integrate multiple inference backends (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM through a single unified configuration), helping users seamlessly experiment and switch between frameworks to find the optimal performance stack for your specific use case. 
Using a SageMaker PyTorch container 
SageMaker offers PyTorch Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) that come with PyTorch and many common libraries pre-installed. In this example, we demonstrated how to extend our prebuilt container to install necessary packages for the model. You can download the model directly from Hugging Face during the endpoint creation or download the Parakeet model artifacts, packaging it with necessary configuration files into a model.tar.gz archive, and uploading it to Amazon S3. Along with the model artifacts, an inference.py script is required as the entry point script to define model loading and inference logic, including audio preprocessing and transcription handling. When using the SageMaker Python SDK to create a PyTorchModel, the SDK will automatically repackage the model archive to include the inference script under /opt/ml/model/code/inference.py, while keeping model artifacts in /opt/ml/model/ on the endpoint. Once the endpoint is deployed successfully, it can be invoked through the predict API by sending audio files as byte streams to get transcription results. 
For the SageMaker real-time endpoint, we currently allow a maximum of 25MB for payload size. Make sure you have set up the container to also allow the maximum request size. However, if you are planning to use the same model for the asynchronous endpoint, the maximum file size that the async endpoint supports is 1GB and the response time is up to 1 hour. Accordingly, you should setup the container to be prepared for this payload size and timeout. When using the PyTorch containers, here are some key configuration parameters to consider: 
 
 SAGEMAKER_MODEL_SERVER_WORKERS: Set the number of torch workers that will load the number of models copied into GPU memory. 
 TS_DEFAULT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT: Set the time out setting for Torch server workers; for long audio processing, you can set it to a higher number 
 TS_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE: Set the byte size values for requests to 1G for async endpoints. 
 TS_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE: Set the byte size values for response. 
 
In the example notebook, we also showcase how to leverage the SageMaker local session provided by the SageMaker Python SDK. It helps you create estimators and run training, processing, and inference jobs locally using Docker containers instead of managed AWS infrastructure, providing a fast way to test and debug your machine learning scripts before scaling to production. 
CDK pipeline prerequisites 
Before deploying this solution, make sure you have: 
 
 AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions ‚Äì Installation Guide 
 AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) installed ‚Äì Installation Guide 
 Node.js 18+ and Python 3.9+ installed 
 Docker ‚Äì Installation Guide 
 SageMaker endpoint deployed with your ML model (Parakeet ASR models or similar) 
 Amazon SNS topics created for success and failure notifications 
 
CDK pipeline setup 
The solution deployment begins with provisioning the necessary AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. AWS CDK creates the foundational components including: 
 
 DynamoDB Table: Configured for on-demand capacity to track invocation metadata, processing status, and results 
 S3 Buckets: Secure storage for input audio files, transcription outputs, and summarization results 
 SNS topics: Separate queues for success and failure event handling 
 Lambda functions: Serverless functions for metadata processing, status updates, and workflow orchestration 
 IAM roles and policies: Appropriate permissions for cross-service communication and resource access 
 
Environment setup 
Clone the repository and install dependencies: 
 
 # Install degit, a library for downloading specific sub directories
npm install -g degit

# Clone just the specific folder
npx degit aws-samples/genai-ml-platform-examples/infrastructure/automated-speech-recognition-async-pipeline-sagemaker-ai/sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk

# Navigate to folder
cd sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Set up Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:

pip install -r requirements.txt 
 
Configuration 
Update the SageMaker endpoint configuration in bin/aws-blog-sagemaker.ts: 
 
  
  vim bin/aws-blog-sagemaker.ts 

# Change the endpoint name 
sageMakerConfig: { 
    endpointName: 'your-sagemaker-endpoint-name',     
    enableSageMakerAccess: true 
} 
  
 
If you have followed the notebook to deploy the endpoint, you should have created the two SNS topics. Otherwise, make sure you create the correct SNS topics using CLI: 
 
 # Create SNS topics
aws sns create-topic --name success-inf
aws sns create-topic --name failed-inf 
 
Build and deploy 
Before you deploy the AWS CloudFormation template, make sure Docker is running. 
 
 # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
npx cdk bootstrap

# Deploy the stack
npx cdk deploy 
 
Verify deployment 
After successful deployment, note the output values: 
 
 DynamoDB table name for status tracking 
 Lambda function ARNs for processing and status updates 
 SNS topic ARNs for notifications 
 
Submit audio file for processing 
Processing Audio Files 
Update the upload_audio_invoke_lambda.sh 
 
 LAMBDA_ARN="YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN"
S3_BUCKET="YOUR_S3_BUCKET_ARN" 
 
Run the Script: 
AWS_PROFILE=default ./scripts/upload_audio_invoke_lambda.sh 
This script will: 
 
 Download a sample audio file 
 Upload the audio file to your s3 bucket 
 Send the bucket path to Lambda and trigger the transcription and summarization pipeline 
 
Monitoring progress 
You can check the result in DynamoDB table using the following command: 
 
 aws dynamodb scan --table-name YOUR_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME 
 
Check processing status in the DynamoDB table: 
 
 submitted: Successfully queued for inference 
 completed: Transcription completed successfully 
 failed: Processing encountered an error 
 
Audio processing and workflow orchestration 
The core processing workflow follows an event-driven pattern: 
Initial processing and metadata extraction: When audio files are uploaded to S3, the triggered Lambda function analyzes the file metadata, validates format compatibility, and creates detailed invocation records in DynamoDB. This facilitates comprehensive tracking from the moment audio content enters the system. 
Asynchronous Speech Recognition: Audio files are processed through the SageMaker endpoint using optimized ASR models. The asynchronous process can handle various file sizes and durations without timeout concerns. Each processing request is assigned a unique identifier for tracking purposes. 
Success path processing: Upon successful transcription, the system automatically initiates the summarization workflow. The transcribed text is sent to Amazon Bedrock, where advanced language models generate contextually appropriate summaries based on configurable parameters such as summary length, focus areas, and output format. 
Error handling and recovery: Failed processing attempts trigger dedicated Lambda functions that log detailed error information, update processing status, and can initiate retry logic for transient failures. This robust error handling results in minimal data loss and provides clear visibility into processing issues. 
Real-world applications 
Customer service analytics: Organizations can process thousands of customer service call recordings to generate transcriptions and summaries, enabling sentiment analysis, quality assurance, and insights extraction at scale. 
Meeting and conference processing: Enterprise teams can automatically transcribe and summarize meeting recordings, creating searchable archives and actionable summaries for participants and stakeholders. 
Media and content processing: Media companies can process podcast episodes, interviews, and video content to generate transcriptions and summaries for improved accessibility and content discoverability. 
Compliance and legal documentation: Legal and compliance teams can process recorded depositions, hearings, and interviews to create accurate transcriptions and summaries for case preparation and documentation. 
Cleanup 
Once you have used the solution, remove the SageMaker endpoints to prevent incurring additional costs. You can use the provided code to delete real-time and asynchronous inference endpoints, respectively: 
 
 # Delete real-time inference
endpointreal_time_predictor.delete_endpoint()

# Delete asynchronous inference
endpointasync_predictor.delete_endpoint() 
 
You should also delete all the resources created by the CDK stack. 
 
 # Delete CDK Stack
cdk destroy
