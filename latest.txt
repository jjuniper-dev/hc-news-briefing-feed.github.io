• NPR US: Does Congress or the president hold war powers? Here's what to know — President Trump's decision to launch airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities without first consulting Congress has drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers who say the move bypasses their constitutional authority to declare war. {Jun 23, 2025}
• NPR US: Were U.S. Strikes On Iran's Nuclear Program Successful? — The U.S. entered Israel's war against Iran over the weekend, dropping bombs and firing missiles on three Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities. We hear from some experts on whether they think the attacks were successful in damaging or destroying Iran's ability to make a nuclear weapon. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long had sights on attacking Iran but until recently that ambition seemed to be sidelined by President Trump. Now Netanyahu's basking in the moment after the U.S. joined in on the war against Iran. For more coverage of all sides of this conflict, go to npr.org/mideastupdates {Jun 23, 2025}

This is the first successful vertical takeoff of a jet-powered flying humanoid robot, developed by Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence (AMI) at Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT). The robot lifted ~50 cm off the ground while maintaining dynamic stability, thanks to advanced AI-based control systems and aerodynamic modeling.We will have much more on this in the coming weeks![Nature] via [IIT]As a first step toward our mission of deploying general-purpose robots, we are pushing the frontiers of what end-to-end AI models can achieve in the real world. We’ve been training models and evaluating their capabilities for dexterous sensorimotor policies across different embodiments, environments, and physical interactions. We’re sharing capability demonstrations on tasks stressing different aspects of manipulation: fine motor control, spatial and temporal precision, generalization across robots and settings, and robustness to external disturbances. [Generalist AI]Thanks, Noah!Ground Control Robotics is introducing SCUTTLE, our newest elongate multilegged platform for mobility anywhere![Ground Control Robotics]Teleoperation has been around for a while, but what hasn’t been is precise, real-time force feedback. That’s where Flexiv steps in to shake things up. Now, whether you’re across the room or across the globe, you can experience seamless, high-fidelity remote manipulation with a sense of touch.This sort of thing usually takes some human training, for which you’d be best served by robot arms with precise, real-time force feedback. Hmm, I wonder where you’d find those...?[Flexiv]The 1X World Model is a data-driven simulator for humanoid robots built with a grounded understanding of physics. It allows us to predict—or “hallucinate”—the outcomes of NEO’s actions before they’re taken in the real world. Using the 1X World Model, we can instantly assess the performance of AI models—compressing development time and providing a clear benchmark for continuous improvement.[1X]SLAPBOT is an interactive robotic artwork by Hooman Samani and Chandler Cheng, exploring the dynamics of physical interaction, artificial agency, and power. The installation features a robotic arm fitted with a soft, inflatable hand that delivers slaps through pneumatic actuation, transforming a visceral human gesture into a programmed robotic response.I asked, of course, whether SLAPBOT slaps people, and it does not: “Despite its provocative concept and evocative design, SLAPBOT does not make physical contact with human participants. It simulates the gesture of slapping without delivering an actual strike. The robotic arm’s movements are precisely choreographed to suggest the act, yet it maintains a safe distance.”[SLAPBOT]Thanks, Hooman!Inspecting the bowels of ships is something we’d really like robots to be doing for us, please and thank you.[Norwegian University of Science and Technology] via [GitHub]Thanks, Kostas!H2L Corporation (hereinafter referred to as H2L) has unveiled a new product called “Capsule Interface,” which transmits whole-body movements and strength, enabling new shared experiences with robots and avatars.
