‚Ä¢ Here‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt have a cold vaccine. Yet.
  For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, it‚Äôs the season of the sniffles. As the weather turns, we‚Äôre all spending more time indoors. The kids have been back at school for a couple of months. And cold germs are everywhere.



My youngest started school this year, and along with artwork and seedlings, she has also been bringing home lots of lovely bugs to share with the rest of her family. As she coughed directly into my face for what felt like the hundredth time, I started to wonder if there was anything I could do to stop this endless cycle of winter illnesses. We all got our flu jabs a month ago. Why couldn‚Äôt we get a vaccine to protect us against the common cold, too?





Scientists have been working on this for decades. It turns out that creating a cold vaccine is hard. Really hard.



But not impossible. There‚Äôs still hope. Let me explain.



Technically, colds are infections that affect your nose and throat, causing symptoms like sneezing, coughing, and generally feeling like garbage. Unlike some other infections,‚Äîcovid-19, for example‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt defined by the specific virus that causes them.



That‚Äôs because there are a lot of viruses that cause colds, including rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, and even seasonal coronaviruses (they don‚Äôt all cause covid!). Within those virus families, there are many different variants.



Take rhinoviruses, for example. These viruses are thought to be behind most colds. They‚Äôre human viruses‚Äîover the course of evolution, they have become perfectly adapted to infecting us, rapidly multiplying in our noses and airways to make us sick. There are around 180 rhinovirus variants, says Gary McLean, a molecular immunologist at Imperial College London in the UK.



Once you factor in the other cold-causing viruses, there are around 280 variants all told. That‚Äôs 280 suspects behind the cough that my daughter sprayed into my face. It‚Äôs going to be really hard to make a vaccine that will offer protection against all of them.



The second challenge lies in the prevalence of those variants.



Scientists tailor flu and covid vaccines to whatever strain happens to be circulating. Months before flu season starts, the World Health Organization advises countries on which strains their vaccines should protect against. Early recommendations for the Northern Hemisphere can be based on which strains seem to be dominant in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.





That approach wouldn‚Äôt work for the common cold, because all those hundreds of variants are circulating all the time, says McLean.



That‚Äôs not to say that people haven‚Äôt tried to make a cold vaccine. There was a flurry of interest in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, when scientists made valiant efforts to develop vaccines for the common cold. Sadly, they all failed. And we haven‚Äôt made much progress since then.



In 2022, a team of researchers reviewed all the research that had been published up to that year. They¬†only identified one clinical trial‚Äîand it was conducted back in 1965.



Interest has certainly died down since then, too. Some question whether a cold vaccine is even worth the effort. After all, most colds don‚Äôt require much in the way of treatment and don‚Äôt last more than a week or two. There are many, many more dangerous viruses out there we could be focusing on.



And while cold viruses do mutate and evolve, no one really expects them to cause the next pandemic, says McLean. They‚Äôve evolved to cause mild disease in humans‚Äîsomething they‚Äôve been doing successfully for a long, long time. Flu viruses‚Äîwhich can cause serious illness, disability, or even death‚Äîpose a much bigger risk, so they probably deserve more attention.



But colds are still irritating, disruptive, and potentially harmful. Rhinoviruses are¬†considered to be the leading cause of human infectious disease. They can cause pneumonia in children and older adults. And once you add up doctor visits, medication, and missed work, the economic cost of colds is pretty hefty: a¬†2003 study put it at $40 billion per year for the US alone.



So it‚Äôs reassuring that we needn‚Äôt abandon all hope: Some scientists are making progress! McLean and his colleagues are working on ways to prepare the immune systems of people with asthma and lung diseases to potentially protect them from cold viruses. And a team at Emory University has developed a vaccine that appears to protect monkeys from around a third of rhinoviruses.



There‚Äôs still a long way to go. Don‚Äôt expect a cold vaccine to materialize in the next five years, at least. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite there yet,‚Äù says Michael Boeckh, an infectious-disease researcher at Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle, Washington. ‚ÄúBut will it at some point happen? Possibly.‚Äù



At the end of our Zoom call, perhaps after reading the disappointed expression on my sniffling, cold-riddled face (yes, I did end up catching my daughter‚Äôs cold), McLean told me he hoped he was ‚Äúpositive enough.‚Äù He admitted that he used to be more optimistic about a cold vaccine. But he hasn‚Äôt given up hope. He‚Äôs even running a trial of a potential new vaccine in people, although he wouldn‚Äôt reveal the details.



‚ÄúIt could be done,‚Äù he said.

Introducing: the new conspiracy age



Everything is a conspiracy theory now. Conspiracists are all over the White House, turning fringe ideas into dangerous policy. America‚Äôs institutions are crumbling under the weight of deep suspicion and the lasting effects of covid isolation. Online echo chambers are getting harder to escape, and generative AI is altering the fabric of truth. A mix of technology and politics has given an unprecedented boost to once-fringe ideas‚Äîbut they are pretty much the same fantasies that have been spreading for hundreds of years.



MIT Technology Review helps break down how this moment is changing science and technology‚Äîand how we can make it through. We‚Äôre thrilled to present The New Conspiracy Age, a new series digging into how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.&nbsp;

Four thoughts from Bill Gates on climate tech



Bill Gates doesn‚Äôt shy away or pretend modesty when it comes to his stature in the climate world today. ‚ÄúWell, who‚Äôs the biggest funder of climate innovation companies?‚Äù he asked a handful of journalists at a media roundtable event last week. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs someone else, I‚Äôve never met them.‚Äù



The former Microsoft CEO has spent the last decade investing in climate technology through Breakthrough Energy, which he founded in 2015. Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he‚Äôs thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Here‚Äôs what he had to say.

How scientists want to make you young againA little over 15 years ago, scientists at Kyoto University in Japan made a remarkable discovery. When they added just four proteins to a skin cell and waited about two weeks, some of the cells underwent an unexpected and astounding transformation: they became young again. They turned into stem cells almost identical to the kind found in a days-old embryo, just beginning life‚Äôs journey.At least in a petri dish, researchers using the procedure can take withered skin cells from a 101-year-old and rewind them so they act as if they‚Äôd never aged at all.Now, after more than a decade of studying and tweaking so-called cellular reprogramming, a number of biotech companies and research labs say they have tantalizing hints that the process could be the gateway to an unprecedented new technology for age reversal.

‚Ä¢ Four thoughts from Bill Gates on climate tech
  Bill Gates doesn‚Äôt shy away or pretend modesty when it comes to his stature in the climate world today. ‚ÄúWell, who‚Äôs the biggest funder of climate innovation companies?‚Äù he asked a handful of journalists at a media roundtable event last week. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs someone else, I‚Äôve never met them.‚Äù



The former Microsoft CEO has spent the last decade investing in climate technology through Breakthrough Energy, which he founded in 2015. Ahead of the UN climate meetings kicking off next week, Gates published a memo outlining what he thinks activists and negotiators should focus on and how he‚Äôs thinking about the state of climate tech right now. Let‚Äôs get into it.&nbsp;



Are we too focused on near-term climate goals?



One of the central points Gates made in his new memo is that he thinks the world is too focused on near-term emissions goals and national emissions reporting.



So in parallel with the national accounting structure for emissions, Gates argues, we should have high-level climate discussions at events like the UN climate conference. Those discussions should take a global view on how to reduce emissions in key sectors like energy and heavy industry.



‚ÄúThe way everybody makes steel, it‚Äôs the same. The way everybody makes cement, it‚Äôs the same. The way we make fertilizer, it‚Äôs all the same,‚Äù he says.



As he noted in one recent essay for MIT Technology Review, he sees innovation as the key to cutting the cost of clean versions of energy, cement, vehicles, and so on. And once products get cheaper, they can see wider adoption.



What‚Äôs most likely to power our grid in the future?



‚ÄúIn the long run, probably either fission or fusion will be the cheapest way to make electricity,‚Äù he says. (It should be noted that, as with most climate technologies, Gates has investments in both fission and fusion companies through Breakthrough Energy Ventures, so he has a vested interest here.)





He acknowledges, though, that reactors likely won‚Äôt come online quickly enough to meet rising electricity demand in the US: ‚ÄúI wish I could deliver nuclear fusion, like, three years earlier than I can.‚Äù



He also spoke to China‚Äôs leadership in both nuclear fission and fusion energy. ‚ÄúThe amount of money they‚Äôre putting [into] fusion is more than the rest of the world put together times two. I mean, it‚Äôs not guaranteed to work. But name your favorite fusion approach here in the US‚Äîthere‚Äôs a Chinese project.‚Äù



Can carbon removal be part of the solution?



I had my colleague James Temple‚Äôs recent story on what‚Äôs next for carbon removal at the top of my mind, so I asked Gates if he saw carbon credits or carbon removal as part of the problematic near-term thinking he wrote about in the memo.



Gates buys offsets to cancel out his own personal emissions, to the tune of about $9 million a year, he said at the roundtable, but doesn‚Äôt expect many of those offsets to make a significant dent in climate progress on a broader scale: ‚ÄúThat stuff, most of those technologies, are a complete dead end. They don‚Äôt get you cheap enough to be meaningful.



‚ÄúCarbon sequestration at $400, $200, $100, can never be a meaningful part of this game. If you have a technology that starts at $400 and can get to $4, then hallelujah, let‚Äôs go. I haven‚Äôt seen that one. There are some now that look like they can get to $40 or $50, and that can play somewhat of a role.‚Äù



&nbsp;Will AI be good news for innovation?&nbsp;



During the discussion, I started a tally in the corner of my notebook, adding a tick every time Gates mentioned AI. Over the course of about an hour, I got to six tally marks, and I definitely missed making a few.



Gates acknowledged that AI is going to add electricity demand, a challenge for a US grid that hasn‚Äôt seen net demand go up for decades. But so too will electric cars and heat pumps.&nbsp;



I was surprised at just how positively he spoke about AI‚Äôs potential, though:



‚ÄúAI will accelerate every innovation pipeline you can name: cancer, Alzheimer&#8217;s, catalysts in material science, you name it. And we&#8217;re all trying to figure out what that means. That is the biggest change agent in the world today, moving at a pace that is very, very rapid ‚Ä¶ every breakthrough energy company will be able to move faster because of using those tools, some very dramatically.‚Äù



I‚Äôll add that, as I‚Äôve noted here before, I‚Äôm skeptical of big claims about AI‚Äôs potential to be a silver bullet across industries, including climate tech. (If you missed it, check out this story about AI and the grid from earlier this year.)¬†

‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs never been easier to be a conspiracy theorist
  The timing was eerie.



On November 21, 1963, Richard Hofstadter delivered the annual Herbert Spencer Lecture at Oxford University. Hofstadter was a professor of American history at Columbia University who liked to use social psychology to explain political history, the better to defend liberalism from extremism on both sides. His new lecture was titled ‚ÄúThe Paranoid Style in American Politics.‚Äù&nbsp;



‚ÄúI call it the paranoid style,‚Äù he began, ‚Äúsimply because no other word adequately evokes the qualities of heated exaggeration, suspiciousness, and conspiratorial fantasy that I have in mind.‚Äù



Then, barely 24 hours later, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. This single, shattering event, and subsequent efforts to explain it, popularized a term for something that is clearly the subject of Hofstadter‚Äôs talk though it never actually figures in the text: ‚Äúconspiracy theory.‚Äù








This story is part of MIT Technology Review‚Äôs series ‚ÄúThe New Conspiracy Age,‚Äù on how the present boom in conspiracy theories is reshaping science and technology.








Hofstadter‚Äôs lecture was later revised into what remains an essential essay, even after decades of scholarship on conspiracy theories, because it lays out, with both rigor and concision, a historical continuity of conspiracist politics. ‚ÄúThe paranoid style is an old and recurrent phenomenon in our public life which has been frequently linked with movements of suspicious discontent,‚Äù he writes, tracing the phenomenon back to the early years of the republic. Though each upsurge in conspiracy theories feels alarmingly novel‚Äînew narratives disseminated through new technologies on a new scale‚Äîthey all conform to a similar pattern. As Hofstadter demonstrated, the names may change, but the fundamental template remains the same.



His psychological reading of politics has been controversial, but it is psychology, rather than economics or other external circumstances, that best explains the flourishing of conspiracy theories. Subsequent research has indeed shown that we are prone to perceive intentionality and patterns where none exist‚Äîand that this helps us feel like a person of consequence. To identify and expose a secret plot is to feel heroic and gain the illusion of control over the bewildering mess of life.&nbsp;





Like many pioneering theories exposed to the cold light of hindsight, Hofstadter‚Äôs has flaws and blind spots. His key oversight was to downplay&nbsp; the paranoid style‚Äôs role in mainstream politics up to that point and underrate its potential to spread in the future.



In 1963, conspiracy theories were still a fringe phenomenon, not because they were inherently unusual but because they had limited reach and were stigmatized by people in power. Now that neither factor holds true, it is obvious how infectious they are. Hofstadter could not, of course, have imagined the information technologies that have become stitched into our lives, nor the fractured media ecosystem of the 21st century, both of which have allowed conspiracist thinking to reach more and more people‚Äîto morph, and to bloom like mold. And he could not have predicted that a serial conspiracy theorist would be elected president, twice, and that he would staff his second administration with fellow proponents of the paranoid style.&nbsp;



But Hofstadter‚Äôs concept of the paranoid style remains useful‚Äîand ever relevant‚Äîbecause it also describes a way of reading the world. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe distinguishing thing about the paranoid style is not that its exponents see conspiracies or plots here or there in history, but they regard a ‚Äòvast‚Äô or ‚Äògigantic‚Äô conspiracy as the motive force in historical events. History is a conspiracy, set in motion by demonic forces of almost transcendent power, and what is felt to be needed to defeat it is not the usual methods of political give-and-take, but an all-out crusade.‚Äù



Needless to say, this mystically unified version of history is not just untrue but impossible. It doesn‚Äôt make sense on any level. So why has it proved so alluring for so long‚Äîand why does it seem to be getting more popular every day?



What is a conspiracy theory, anyway?&nbsp;



The first person to define the ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù as a widespread phenomenon was the Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper, in his 1948 lecture ‚ÄúTowards a Rational Theory of Tradition.‚Äù He was not referring to a theory about an individual conspiracy. He was interested in ‚Äúthe conspiracy theory of society‚Äù: a particular way of interpreting the course of events.&nbsp;



He later defined it as ‚Äúthe view that an explanation of a social phenomenon consists in the discovery of the men or groups who are interested in the occurrence of this phenomenon (sometimes it is a hidden interest which has first to be revealed), and who have planned and conspired to bring it about.‚Äù



Take an unforeseen catastrophe that inspires fear, anger, and pain‚Äîa financial crash, a devastating fire, a terrorist attack, a war. The conventional historian will try to unpick a tangle of different factors, of which malice is only one, and one that may be less significant than dumb luck.



The conspiracist, however, will perceive only sinister calculation behind these terrible events‚Äîa fiendishly intricate plot conceived and executed to perfection. Intent is everything. Popper‚Äôs observation chimes with Hofstadter‚Äôs: ‚ÄúThe paranoid‚Äôs interpretation of history is ‚Ä¶ distinctly personal: decisive events are not taken as part of the stream of history, but as the consequences of someone‚Äôs will.‚Äù



A Culture of ConspiracyMichael BarkunUNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA PRESS, 2013




According to Michael Barkun in the 2003 book A Culture of Conspiracy, the conspiracist interpretation of events rests on three assumptions: Everything is connected, everything is premeditated, and nothing is as it seems. Following that third law means that widely accepted and documented history is, by definition, suspect and alternative explanations, however outr√©, are more likely to be true. As Hannah Arendt wrote in The Origins of Totalitarianism, the purpose of conspiracy theories in 20th-century dictatorships ‚Äúwas always to reveal official history as a joke, to demonstrate a sphere of secret influences in which the visible, traceable, and known historical reality was only the outward fa√ßade erected explicitly to fool the people.‚Äù (Those dictators, of course, were conspirators themselves, projecting their own love of secret plots onto others.)




Still, it‚Äôs important to remember that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù can mean different things. Barkun describes three varieties, nesting like Russian dolls.&nbsp;



The ‚Äúevent conspiracy theory‚Äù concerns a specific, contained catastrophe, such as the Reichstag fire of 1933 or the origins of covid-19. These theories are relatively plausible, even if they can not be proved.&nbsp;



The ‚Äúsystemic conspiracy theory‚Äù is much more ambitious, purporting to explain numerous events as the poisonous fruit of a clandestine international plot. Far-fetched though they are, they do at least fixate on named groups, whether the Illuminati or the World Economic Forum.&nbsp;





It is increasingly clear that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy belief.




Finally, the ‚Äúsuperconspiracy theory‚Äù is that impossible fantasy in which history itself is a conspiracy, orchestrated by unseen forces of almost supernatural power and malevolence. The most extreme variants of QAnon posit such a universal conspiracy. It seeks to encompass and explain nothing less than the entire world.



These are very different genres of storytelling. If the first resembles a detective story, then the other two are more akin to fables. Yet one can morph into the other. Take the theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination. The first wave of amateur investigators created event conspiracy theories‚Äîrelatively self-contained plots with credible assassins such as Cubans or the Mafia.&nbsp;



But over time, event conspiracy theories have come to seem parochial. By the time of Oliver Stone‚Äôs 1991 movie JFK, once-popular plots had been eclipsed by elaborate fictions of gigantic long-running conspiracies in which the murder of the president was just one component. One of Stone‚Äôs primary sources was the journalist Jim Marrs, who went on to write books about the Freemasons and UFOs.&nbsp;



Why limit yourself to a laboriously researched hypothesis about a single event when one giant, dramatic plot can explain them all?&nbsp;



The theory of everything&nbsp;



In every systemic or superconspiracy theory, the world is corrupt and unjust and getting worse. An elite cabal of improbably powerful individuals, motivated by pure malignancy, is responsible for most of humanity‚Äôs misfortunes. Only through the revelation of hidden knowledge and the cracking of codes by a righteous minority can the malefactors be unmasked and defeated. The morality is as simplistic as the narrative is complex: It is a battle between good and evil.



Notice anything? This is not the language of democratic politics but that of myth and of religion. In fact, it is the fundamental message of the Book of Revelation. Conspiracist thinking can be seen as an offshoot, often but not always secularized, of apocalyptic Christianity, with its alluring web of prophecies, signs, and secrets and its promise of violent resolution. After studying several millenarian sects for his 1957 book The Pursuit of the Millennium, the historian Norman Cohn itemized some common traits, among them ‚Äúthe megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect, wholly good, abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph; the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers to the adversary; the refusal to accept the ineluctable limitations and imperfections of human experience.‚Äù



Popper similarly considered the conspiracy theory of society ‚Äúa typical result of the secularization of religious superstition,‚Äù adding: ‚ÄúThe gods are abandoned. But their place is filled by powerful men or groups ‚Ä¶ whose wickedness is responsible for all the evils we suffer from.‚Äù&nbsp;



QAnon‚Äôs mutation from a conspiracy theory on an internet message board into a movement with the characteristics of a cult makes explicit the kinship between conspiracy theories and apocalyptic religion.



This way of thinking facilitates the creation of dehumanized scapegoats‚Äîone of the oldest and most consistent features of a conspiracy theory. During the Middle Ages and beyond, political and religious leaders routinely flung the name ‚ÄúAntichrist‚Äù at their opponents. During the Crusades, Christians falsely accused Europe‚Äôs Jewish communities of collaborating with Islam or poisoning wells and put them to the sword. Witch-hunters implicated tens of thousands of innocent women in a supposed satanic conspiracy that was said to explain everything from illness to crop failure. ‚ÄúConspiracy theories are, in the end, not so much an explanation of events as they are an effort to assign blame,‚Äù writes Anna Merlan in the 2019 book Republic of Lies.



Republic of Lies: American Conspiracy Theorists and Their Surprising Rise to PowerAnna MerlanMETROPOLITAN PUBLISHERS, 2019




But the systemic conspiracy theory as we know it‚Äîthat is, the ostensibly secular variety‚Äîwas established three centuries later, with remarkable speed. Some horrified opponents of the French Revolution could not accept that such an upheaval could be simply a popular revolt and needed to attribute it to sinister, unseen forces. They settled on the Illuminati, a Bavarian secret society of Enlightenment intellectuals influenced in part by the rituals and hierarchy of Freemasonry.&nbsp;



The group was founded by a young law professor named Adam Weishaupt, who used the alias Brother Spartacus. In reality, the Illuminati were few in number, fractious, powerless, and, by the time of the revolution in 1789, defunct. But in the imaginations of two influential writers who published ‚Äúexpos√©s‚Äù of the Illuminati in 1797‚ÄîScotland‚Äôs John Robison and France‚Äôs Augustin Barruel‚Äîthey were everywhere. Each man erected a wobbling tower of wild supposition and feverish nonsense on a platform of plausible claims and verifiable facts. Robison alleged that the revolution was merely part of ‚Äúone great and wicked project‚Äù whose ultimate aim was to ‚Äúabolish all religion, overturn every government, and make the world a general plunder and a wreck.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



The Illuminati‚Äôs bogeyman status faded during the 19th century, but the core narrative persisted and proceeded to underpin the notorious hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, first published in a Russian newspaper in 1903. The document‚Äôs anonymous author reinvented antisemitism by grafting it onto the story of the one big plot and positing Jews as the secret rulers of the world. In this account, the Elders orchestrate every war, recession, and so on in order to destabilize the world to the point where they can impose tyranny.&nbsp;



You might ask why, if they have such world-bending power already, they would require a dictatorship. You might also wonder how one group could be responsible for both communism and monopoly capitalism, anarchism and democracy, the theory of evolution, and much more besides. But the vast, self-contradicting incoherence of the plot is what made it impossible to disprove. Nothing was ruled out, so every development could potentially be taken as evidence of the Elders at work.



In 1921, the Protocols were exposed as what the London Times called a ‚Äúclumsy forgery,‚Äù plagiarized from two obscure 19th-century novels, yet they remained the key text of European antisemitism‚Äîessentially ‚Äútrue‚Äù despite being demonstrably false. ‚ÄúI believe in the inner, but not the factual, truth of the Protocols,‚Äù said Joseph Goebbels, who would become Hitler‚Äôs minister of propaganda. In Mein Kampf, Hitler claimed that efforts to debunk the Protocols were actually ‚Äúevidence in favor of their authenticity.‚Äù He alleged that Jews, if not stopped, would ‚Äúone day devour the other nations and become lords of the earth.‚Äù Popper and Hofstadter both used the Holocaust as an example of what happens when a conspiracy theorist gains power and makes the paranoid style a governing principle.



STEPHANIE ARNETT/MIT TECHNOLOGY REVIEW | PUBLIC DOMAIN




The prominent role of Jewish Bolsheviks like Leon Trotsky and Grigory Zinoviev in the Russian Revolution of 1917 enabled a merger of antisemitism and anticommunism that survived the fascist era. Cold War red-baiters such as Senator Joseph McCarthy and the John Birch Society assigned to communists uncanny degrees of malice and ubiquity, far beyond the real threat of Soviet espionage. In fact, they presented this view as the only logical one. McCarthy claimed that a string of national security setbacks could be explained only if George C. Marshall, the secretary of defense and former secretary of state, was literally a Soviet agent. ‚ÄúHow can we account for our present situation unless we believe that men high in this government are concerting to deliver us to disaster?‚Äù he asked in 1951. ‚ÄúThis must be the product of a great conspiracy so immense as to dwarf any previous such venture in the history of man.‚Äù



This continuity between antisemitism, anticommunism, and 18th-century paranoia about secret societies isn‚Äôt hard to see. General Francisco Franco, Spain‚Äôs right-wing dictator, claimed to be fighting a ‚ÄúJudeo-Masonic-Bolshevik‚Äù conspiracy. The Nazis persecuted Freemasons alongside Jews and communists. Nesta Webster, the British fascist sympathizer who laundered the Protocols through the British press, revived interest in Robison and Barruel‚Äôs books about the Illuminati, which the pro-Nazi Baptist preacher Gerald Winrod then promoted in the US. Even Winston Churchill was briefly persuaded by Webster‚Äôs work, citing it in his claims of a ‚Äúworld-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization ‚Ä¶ from the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to the days of Karl Marx.‚Äù



To follow the chain further, Webster and Winrod‚Äôs stew of anticommunism, antisemitism, and anti-Illuminati conspiracy theories influenced the John Birch Society, whose publications would light a fire decades later under the Infowars founder Alex Jones, perhaps the most consequential conspiracy theorist of the early 21st century.¬†



The villains behind the one big plot might be the Illuminati, the Elders of Zion, the communists, or the New World Order, but they are always essentially the same people, aspiring to officially dominate a world that they already secretly control. The names can be swapped around without much difficulty. While Winrod maintained that ‚Äúthe real conspirators behind the Illuminati were Jews,‚Äù the anticommunist William Guy Carr conversely argued that antisemitic paranoia ‚Äúplays right into the hands of the Illuminati.‚Äù These days, it might be the World Economic Forum or George Soros; liberal internationalists with aspirations to change the world are easily cast as the new Illuminati, working toward establishing one world government.



Finding connection



The main reason that conspiracy theorists have lost interest in the relatively hard work of micro-conspiracies in favor of grander schemes is that it has become much easier to draw lines between objectively unrelated people and events. Information technology is, after all, also misinformation technology. That‚Äôs nothing new.&nbsp;



The witch craze could not have traveled as far or lasted as long without the printing press. Malleus Maleficarum (Hammer of the Witches), a 1486 screed by the German witch-hunter Heinrich Kramer, became the best-selling witch-hunter‚Äôs handbook, going through 28 editions by 1600. Similarly, it was the books and pamphlets ‚Äúexposing‚Äù the Illuminati that allowed those ideas to spread everywhere following the French Revolution. And in the early 20th century, the introduction of the radio facilitated fascist propaganda. During the 1930s, the Nazi-sympathizing Catholic priest and radio host Charles Coughlin broadcast his antisemitic conspiracy theories to tens of millions of Americans on dozens of stations.&nbsp;



The internet has, of course, vastly accelerated and magnified the spread of conspiracy theories. It is hard to recall now, but in the early days it was sweetly assumed that the internet would improve the world by democratizing access to information. While this initial idealism survives in doughty enclaves such as Wikipedia, most of us vastly underestimated the human appetite for false information that confirms the consumer‚Äôs biases.



Politicians, too, were slow to recognize the corrosive power of free-flowing conspiracy theories. For a long time, the more fantastical assertions of McCarthy and the Birchers were kept at arm‚Äôs length from the political mainstream, but that distance began to diminish rapidly during the 1990s, as right-wing activists built a cottage industry of outrageous claims about Bill and Hillary Clinton to advance the idea that they were not just corrupt or dishonest but actively evil and even satanic. This became an article of faith in the information ecosystem of internet message boards and talk radio, which expanded over time to include Fox News, blogs, and social media. So when Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016, a significant portion of the American public saw a monster at the heart of an organized crime ring whose activities included human trafficking and murder.



Nobody could make the same mistake about misinformation today. One could hardly design a more fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories than social media. The algorithms of YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, and X, which operate on the principle that rage is engaging, have turned into radicalization machines. When these platforms took off during the second half of the 2010s, they offered a seamless system in which people were able to come across exciting new information, share it, connect it to other strands of misinformation, and weave them into self-contained, self-affirming communities, all without leaving the house.



It‚Äôs not hard to see how the problem will continue to grow as AI burrows ever deeper into our everyday lives. Elon Musk has tinkered with the AI chatbot Grok to produce information that conforms to his personal beliefs rather than to actual facts. This outcome does not even have to be intentional. Chatbots have been shown to validate and intensify some users‚Äô beliefs, even if they‚Äôre rooted in paranoia or hubris. If you believe that you‚Äôre the hero in an epic battle between good and evil, then your chatbot is inclined to agree with you.



It‚Äôs all this digital noise that has brought about the virtual collapse of the event conspiracy theory. The industry produced by the JFK assassination may have been pseudo-scholarship, but at least researchers went through the motions of scrutinizing documents, gathering evidence, and putting forward a somewhat consistent hypothesis. However misguided the conclusions, that kind of conspiracy theory required hard work and commitment.&nbsp;



CARL MYDANS/THE LIFE PICTURE COLLECTION/SHUTTERSTOCK




Today‚Äôs online conspiracy theorists, by contrast, are shamelessly sloppy. Events such as the attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in October 2022, or the murders of Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in June 2025, or even more recently the killing of Charlie Kirk, have inspired theories overnight, which then evaporate just as quickly. The point of such theories, if they even merit that label, is not to seek the truth but to defame political opponents and turn victims into villains.



Before he even ran for office, Trump was notorious for promoting false stories about Barack Obama‚Äôs birthplace or vaccine safety. Heir to Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater, and the John Birch Society, he is the lurid incarnation of the paranoid style. He routinely damns his opponents as ‚Äúevil‚Äù or ‚Äúvery bad people‚Äù and speaks of America‚Äôs future in apocalyptic terms. It is no surprise, then, that every member of the administration must subscribe to Trump‚Äôs false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, or that celebrity conspiracy theorists are now in charge of national intelligence, public health, and the FBI. Former Democrats who hold such roles, like Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have entered Trump‚Äôs orbit through the gateway of conspiracy theories. They illustrate how this mindset can create counterintuitive alliances that collapse conventional political distinctions and scramble traditional notions of right and left.&nbsp;



The antidemocratic implications of what‚Äôs happening today are obvious. ‚ÄúSince what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil, the quality needed is not a willingness to compromise but the will to fight things out to the finish,‚Äù Hofstadter wrote. ‚ÄúNothing but complete victory will do.‚Äù&nbsp;



Meeting the moment



It‚Äôs easy to feel helpless in the face of this epistemic chaos. Because one other foundational feature of religious prophecy is that it can be disproved without being discredited: Perhaps the world does not come to an end on the predicted day, but that great day will still come. The prophet is never wrong‚Äîhe is just not proven right yet.&nbsp;



The same flexibility is enjoyed by systemic conspiracy theories. The plotters never actually succeed, nor are they ever decisively exposed, yet the theory remains intact. Recently, claims that covid-19 was either exaggerated or wholly fabricated in order to crush civil liberties did not wither away once lockdown restrictions were lifted. Surely the so-called ‚Äúplandemic‚Äù was a complete disaster? No matter. This type of conspiracy theory does not have to make sense.



Scholars who have attempted to methodically repudiate conspiracy theories about the 9/11 attacks or the JFK assassination have found that even once all the supporting pillars have been knocked away, the edifice still stands. It is increasingly clear that ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù is a misnomer and what we are really dealing with is conspiracy belief‚Äîas Hofstadter suggested, a worldview buttressed with numerous cognitive biases and impregnable to refutation. As Goebbels implied, the ‚Äúfactual truth‚Äù pales in comparison to the ‚Äúinner truth,‚Äù which is whatever somebody believes it be.



But at the very least, what we can do is identify the entirely different realities constructed by believers and recognize and internalize their common roots, tropes, and motives.&nbsp;



Those different realities, after all, have proved remarkably consistent in shape if not in their details. What we saw then, we see now. The Illuminati were Enlightenment idealists whose liberal agenda to ‚Äúdispel the clouds of superstition and of prejudice,‚Äù in Weishaupt‚Äôs words, was demonized as wicked and destructive. If they could be shown to have fomented the French Revolution, then the whole revolution was a sham. Similarly, today‚Äôs radical right recasts every plank of progressive politics as an anti-American conspiracy. The far-right Great Replacement Theory, for instance, posits that immigration policy is a calculated effort by elites to supplant the native population with outsiders. This all flows directly from what thinkers such as Hofstadter, Popper, and Arendt diagnosed more than 60 years ago.&nbsp;



What is dangerously novel, at least in democracies, is conspiracy theories‚Äô ubiquity, reach, and power to affect the lives of ordinary citizens. So understanding the paranoid style better equips us to counteract it in our daily existence. At minimum, this knowledge empowers us to spot the flaws and biases in our own thinking and stop ourselves from tumbling down dangerous rabbit holes.&nbsp;



The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other EssaysRichard HofstadterVINTAGE BOOKS, 1967




On November 18, 1961, President Kennedy‚Äîalmost exactly two years before Hofstadter‚Äôs lecture and his own assassination‚Äîoffered his own definition of the paranoid style in a speech to the Democratic Party of California. ‚ÄúThere have always been those on the fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAt times these fanatics have achieved a temporary success among those who lack the will or the wisdom to face unpleasant facts or unsolved problems. But in time the basic good sense and stability of the great American consensus has always prevailed.‚Äù&nbsp;



We can only hope that the consensus begins to see the rolling chaos and naked aggression of Trump‚Äôs two administrations as weighty evidence against the conspiracy theory of society. The notion that any group could successfully direct the larger mess of this moment in the world, let alone the course of history for decades, undetected, is palpably absurd. The important thing is not that the details of this or that conspiracy theory are wrong; it is that the entire premise behind this worldview is false.&nbsp;



Not everything is connected, not everything is premeditated, and many things are in fact just as they seem.&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies
  Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.

First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.
In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS clocking at 6.3 terabits per second &#8212; the biggest attack that Google had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.
These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.
&#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&#8221; wrote Roland Dobbins, principal engineer at Netscout, in a recent executive summary on Aisuru. &#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&#8221;
The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.
Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &#8220;residential proxy&#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.

From a website‚Äôs perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes ‚Äî such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.
And as we&#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.
&#8216;INSANE&#8217; GROWTH
Riley Kilmer is co-founder of spur.us, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown exponentially over the past six months &#8212; with some adding between 10 to 200 times more proxies for rent.
&#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&#8221;
To put Kilmer&#8217;s comments in perspective, here was Spur&#8217;s view of the Top 10 proxy networks by approximate install base, circa May 2025:
AUPROXIES_PROXY¬† 66,097
RAYOBYTE_PROXY¬† ¬† 43,894
OXYLABS_PROXY¬† ¬†43,008
WEBSHARE_PROXY¬† ¬†39,800
IPROYAL_PROXY¬† ¬† 32,723
PROXYCHEAP_PROXY¬† ¬† 26,368
IPIDEA_PROXY¬† ¬† 26,202
MYPRIVATEPROXY_PROXY¬† 25,287
HYPE_PROXY¬† ¬† 18,185
MASSIVE_PROXY¬† ¬† 17,152
Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;
LUMINATI_PROXY¬† ¬† 11,856,421
NETNUT_PROXY¬† ¬† 10,982,458
ABCPROXY_PROXY¬† ¬† 9,294,419
OXYLABS_PROXY¬† ¬† ¬†6,754,790
IPIDEA_PROXY¬† ¬† ¬†3,209,313
EARNFM_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,659,913
NODEMAVEN_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,627,851
INFATICA_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,335,194
IPROYAL_PROXY¬† ¬† 2,032,027
YILU_PROXY¬† ¬† 1,549,155
Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.
&#8220;We don‚Äôt systematically track other providers‚Äô figures, and we‚Äôre not aware of any instances of 10√ó or 100√ó growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&#8221; the company said in a written statement.
Bright Data was formerly known as Luminati Networks, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks, with more than 11 million proxies. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.
&#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&#8217;s in some way,&#8221; said Rony Shalit, Bright Data&#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&#8221;
&#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and a robust opt-in only residential peers, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&#8221; Shalit continued. &#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&#8221;
HK NETWORK
Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &#8220;know-your-customer&#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.
Benjamin Brundage is founder of Synthient, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.
Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own software development kit or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.
&#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&#8221;
Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is forced to install some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.
Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.
&#8220;Often, you&#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&#8221;
Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy provider that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.
Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&#8217;s largest residential proxy service is IPidea, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include ABCProxy (#3), Roxlabs, LunaProxy, PIA S5 Proxy, PyProxy, 922Proxy, 360Proxy, IP2World, and Cherry Proxy.¬†Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said they also track Yilu Proxy¬†(#10) as IPidea.
Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &#8220;HK Network.&#8221;
&#8220;The way it works is there&#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,'&#8221; Brundage explained. &#8220;But they&#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&#8221;
A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.
Those apps include a range of low-cost and &#8220;free&#8221; virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user&#8217;s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.
&#8220;They have all this bandwidth to offload,&#8221; Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. &#8220;And they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.&#8221;
One of IPidea&#8217;s core brands is 922S5Proxy, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the 911S5Proxy service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after the company&#8217;s servers were massively hacked.
That 2022 story named Yunhe Wang from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested Mr Wang, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.

DATA SCRAPING FOR AI
In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.
&#8220;It&#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&#8221; Spur&#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.
Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.
&#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&#8221; Kilmer said. &#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&#8221;
Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.
&#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&#8217;t access the data &#8212; they&#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.
Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly are overloading community-maintained infrastructure, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A report earlier this year from LibreNews found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.
Cloudflare is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&#8217;s &#8220;pay-per-crawl&#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.
On October 22, the social media and news network Reddit sued Oxylabs (PDF) and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.
&#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google‚Äôs search results instead,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&#8221;
Denas Grybauskas, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.
&#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs‚Äô position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&#8221;
As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI‚Äôs Internet Crime Complaint Center warned that an IoT malware threat dubbed BADBOX 2.0 had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.
In July, Google filed a lawsuit in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&#8221;
A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME
Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name fuckbriankrebs[.]com. This may be little more than an elaborate &#8220;screw you&#8221; to this site&#8217;s author: One of the botnet&#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &#8220;Forky,&#8221; and was identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &#8220;kill switch&#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.
A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.
For one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by Philippe Caturegli, &#8220;chief hacking officer&#8221; for the security intelligence company Seralys.
Caturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com.
But even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.
&#8220;The bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.&#8221;
Caturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.
The domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was used to spread malicious software by the Cutwail spam botnet. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by Russkill (a.k.a. &#8220;Dirt Jumper&#8221;).
Domaintools.com finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to David &#8220;Abdilo&#8221; Crees, a 27-year-old Australian man sentenced in May 2025 to time served for cybercrime convictions related to the Lizard Squad hacking group.

‚Ä¢ Reduce CAPTCHAs for AI agents browsing the web with Web Bot Auth (Preview) in Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser
  AI agents need to browse the web on your behalf. When your agent visits a website to gather information, complete a form, or verify data, it encounters the same defenses designed to stop unwanted bots: CAPTCHAs, rate limits, and outright blocks. 
Today, we are excited to share that AWS has a solution. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser, our secure, cloud-based browser for AI agents to interact with websites, now supports Web Bot Auth (in preview), a draft IETF protocol that gives agents verifiable cryptographic identities. 
CAPTCHA friction 
Customers tell us that CAPTCHA friction is one of the biggest obstacles to reliable browser-based agentic workflows. Your agent halts mid-task, waiting for human intervention to solve a puzzle that proves you‚Äôre not a bot ‚Äì except your agent is a bot, and that‚Äôs the point. CAPTCHAs exist for good reason. Websites face constant challenges protecting their content, inventory and reviews. Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and bot detection services protect these sites, but they treat nearly all automated traffic as suspicious because they have no reliable way to distinguish legitimate agents from malicious ones. 
Some automation providers try to solve CAPTCHAs programmatically ‚Äì using computer vision models to read distorted text or clicking through image grids until the puzzle clears. This approach is brittle, expensive, and is bypassing controls that domain owners intended for their content. Other approaches rely on IP allowlists or User-Agent strings. IP allowlists break when you run agents in cloud environments where addresses change frequently. User-Agent strings can be spoofed by anyone, so they provide no verification, and pose a risk of people emulating well trusted strings. Both methods require manual coordination with every website you want to access, which does not scale. 
Web Bot Auth: Cryptographic identity for agents browsing the web 
Web Bot Auth is a draft IETF protocol that gives agents verifiable cryptographic identities. When you enable Web Bot Auth in AgentCore Browser, we issue cryptographic credentials that websites can verify. The agent presents these credentials with every request. The WAF may now additionally check the signature, confirm it matches a trusted directory, and allow the request through if verified bots are allowed by the domain owner and other WAF checks are clear. 
AgentCore is working with Cloudflare, HUMAN Security, and Akamai Technologies to support this verification flow. These providers protect millions of websites. When you create an AgentCore Browser with signing enabled in the configuration, we automatically register your agent‚Äôs signature directory with these providers. Many domains already configure their WAFs to allow verified bots by default, which means you can see immediate CAPTCHA reduction without additional setup in the cases that this happens. 
How domain owners control access 
WAF providers give website owners three levels of control using Web Bot Auth: 
 
 Block all bots ‚Äì Some sites choose to block automated traffic entirely. Web Bot Auth does not bypass this ‚Äì if a domain wants no automation, that choice is respected. 
 Allow verified bots ‚Äì Many domains configure their WAF to allow any bot that presents a valid cryptographic signature. This is the default policy for a growing number of sites protected by Cloudflare, HUMAN Security, and Akamai Technologies. When you enable signing, as a parameter in the AgentCore Browser configuration, this policy will apply to your agents. 
 Allow specific verified bots to conduct only specific actions ‚Äì For example, a financial services company automating vendor portal access can share its unique directory with those vendors. The vendor can create rules like ‚Äúallow FinCo agents at 100 requests per minute, don‚Äôt allow them to create new accounts, and block all other signed agents.‚Äù This gives websites granular control while preserving the benefits of cryptographic verification. 
 
Today‚Äôs preview release of Web Both Auth support in AgentCore Browser helps reduce friction with CAPTCHAs on domains that allow verified bots, by making your agent appear as a verified bot. Once the Web Bot Auth protocol is finalized, AgentCore intends to transition to customer-specific keys, so AgentCore users can use the tier of control that allows only specified verified bots. 
Using the Web Bot Auth protocol 
To enable the browser to sign requests using the Web Bot Auth protocol, create a browser tool with the browserSigning configuration: 
 
 import boto3
cp_client = boto3.client('bedrock-agentcore-control')
response = cp_client.create_browser(
    name="signed_browser",
    description="Browser tool with Web Bot Auth enabled",
    networkConfiguration={
        "networkMode": "PUBLIC"
    },
    executionRoleArn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AgentCoreExecutionRole",
    browserSigning={
        "enabled": True
    }
)
browserId = response['browserId']
 
 
Pass the browser identifier to your agent framework. Here is an example using Strands Agents: 
 
 from strands import Agent
from strands_tools.browser import AgentCoreBrowser
agent_core_browser = AgentCoreBrowser(
    region="us-west-2",
    identifier=browserId
)
strands_agent = Agent(
    tools=[agent_core_browser.browser],
    model="anthropic.claude-4-5-haiku-20251001-v1:0",
    system_prompt="You are a website analyst. Use the browser tool efficiently."
)
result = strands_agent("Analyze the website at &lt;https://example.com/&gt;")
 
 
The agent is now configured to use the new browser tool that signs every HTTP request. Websites protected by Cloudflare, HUMAN Security, or Akamai Technologies can verify the signature and allow the request through without presenting a CAPTCHA, if the domain owner allows verified bots. 
Protocol development 
The Web Bot Auth protocol is gaining industry momentum because it solves a real problem: legitimate automation is indistinguishable from abuse without verifiable identity. You can read the draft protocol specification, HTTP Message Signatures for automated traffic Architecture. The architecture defines how agents generate signatures, how WAFs verify them, and how key directories enable discovery. Amazon is working with Cloudflare and many popular WAF providers to help finalize the customer-specific key directory format and work towards finalizing the draft. 
Conclusion 
Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser is generally available, with the Web Bot Auth feature available in preview. AgentCore Browser signing requests using the Web Bot Auth protocol help reduce friction with CAPTCHA across domains that allow verified bots. As the protocol finalizes, AgentCore Browser intends to issue customer-specific keys and directories, so you can prove your agent‚Äôs identity to specific websites and establish trust relationships directly with the domains you need to access. 
Web Bot Auth enables agents to prove their identity when challenged, reduces operational friction in automated workflows, and gives website owners control over which agents access their resources. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser support for Web Bot Auth (Preview) provides the infrastructure layer that makes this possible.

‚Ä¢ Hosting NVIDIA speech NIM models on Amazon SageMaker AI: Parakeet ASR
  This post was written with NVIDIA and the authors would like to thank Adi Margolin, Eliuth Triana, and Maryam Motamedi for their collaboration. 
Organizations today face the challenge of processing large volumes of audio data‚Äìfrom customer calls and meeting recordings to podcasts and voice messages‚Äìto unlock valuable insights. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a critical first step in this process, converting speech to text so that further analysis can be performed. However, running ASR at scale is computationally intensive and can be expensive. This is where asynchronous inference on Amazon SageMaker AI comes in. By deploying state-of-the-art ASR models (like NVIDIA Parakeet models) on SageMaker AI with asynchronous endpoints, you can handle large audio files and batch workloads efficiently. With asynchronous inference, long-running requests can be processed in the background (with results delivered later); it also supports auto-scaling to zero when there‚Äôs no work and handles spikes in demand without blocking other jobs. 
In this blog post, we‚Äôll explore how to host the NVIDIA Parakeet ASR model on SageMaker AI and integrate it into an asynchronous pipeline for scalable audio processing. We‚Äôll also highlight the benefits of Parakeet‚Äôs architecture and the NVIDIA Riva toolkit for speech AI, and discuss how to use NVIDIA NIM for deployment on AWS. 
NVIDIA speech AI technologies: Parakeet ASR and Riva Framework 
NVIDIA offers a comprehensive suite of speech AI technologies, combining high-performance models with efficient deployment solutions. At its core, the Parakeet ASR model family represents state-of-the-art speech recognition capabilities, achieving industry-leading accuracy with low word error rates (WERs) . The model‚Äôs architecture uses the Fast Conformer encoder with the CTC or transducer decoder, enabling 2.4√ó faster processing than standard Conformers while maintaining accuracy. 
NVIDIA speech NIM is a collection of GPU-accelerated microservices for building customizable speech AI applications. NVIDIA Speech models deliver accurate transcription accuracy and natural, expressive voices in over 36 languages‚Äìideal for customer service, contact centers, accessibility, and global enterprise workflows. Developers can fine-tune and customize models for specific languages, accents, domains, and vocabularies, supporting accuracy and brand voice alignment. 
Seamless integration with LLMs and the NVIDIA Nemo Retriever make NVIDIA models ideal for agentic AI applications, helping your organization stand out with more secure, high-performing, voice AI. The NIM framework delivers these services as containerized solutions, making deployment straightforward through Docker containers that include the necessary dependencies and optimizations. 
This combination of high-performance models and deployment tools provides organizations with a complete solution for implementing speech recognition at scale. 
Solution overview 
The architecture illustrated in the diagram showcases a comprehensive asynchronous inference pipeline designed specifically for ASR and summarization workloads. The solution provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective processing pipeline. 
 
Architecture components 
The architecture consists of five key components working together to create an efficient audio processing pipeline. At its core, the SageMaker AI asynchronous endpoint hosts the Parakeet ASR model with auto scaling capabilities that can scale to zero when idle for cost optimization. 
 
 The data ingestion process begins when audio files are uploaded to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), triggering AWS Lambda functions that process metadata and initiate the workflow. 
 For event processing, the SageMaker endpoint automatically sends out Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) success and failure notifications through separate queues, enabling proper handling of transcriptions. 
 Successfully transcribed content on Amazon S3 moves to Amazon Bedrock LLMs for intelligent summarization and additional processing like classification and insights extraction. 
 Finally, a comprehensive tracking system using Amazon DynamoDB stores workflow status and metadata, enabling real-time monitoring and analytics of the entire pipeline. 
 
Detailed implementation walkthrough 
In this section, we will provide the detailed walkthrough of the solution implementation. 
SageMaker asynchronous endpoint prerequisites 
To run the example notebooks, you need an AWS account with an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with least-privilege permissions to manage resources created. For details, refer to Create an AWS account. You might need to request a service quota increase for the corresponding SageMaker async hosting instances. In this example, we need one ml.g5.xlarge SageMaker async hosting instance and a ml.g5.xlarge SageMaker notebook instance. You can also choose a different integrated development environment (IDE), but make sure the environment contains GPU compute resources for local testing. 
SageMaker asynchronous endpoint configuration 
When you deploy a custom model like Parakeet, SageMaker has a couple of options: 
 
 Use a NIM container provided by NVIDIA 
 Use a large model inference (LMI) container 
 Use a prebuilt PyTorch container 
 
We‚Äôll provide examples for all three approaches. 
Using an NVIDIA NIM container 
NVIDIA NIM provides a streamlined approach to deploying optimized AI models through containerized solutions. Our implementation takes this concept further by creating a unified SageMaker AI endpoint that intelligently routes between HTTP and gRPC protocols to help maximize both performance and capabilities while simplifying the deployment process. 
Innovative dual-protocol architecture 
The key innovation is the combined HTTP + gRPC architecture that exposes a single SageMaker AI endpoint with intelligent routing capabilities. This design addresses the common challenge of choosing between protocol efficiency and feature completeness by automatically selecting the optimal transport method. The HTTP route is optimized for simple transcription tasks with files under 5MB, providing faster processing and lower latency for common use cases. Meanwhile, the gRPC route supports larger files (SageMaker AI real-time endpoints support a max payload of 25MB) and advanced features like speaker diarization with precise word-level timing information. The system‚Äôs auto-routing functionality analyzes incoming requests to determine file size and requested features, then automatically selects the most appropriate protocol without requiring manual configuration. For applications that need explicit control, the endpoint also supports forced routing through /invocations/http for simple transcription or /invocations/grpc when speaker diarization is required. This flexibility allows both automated optimization and fine-grained control based on specific application requirements. 
Advanced speech recognition and speaker diarization capabilities 
The NIM container enables a comprehensive audio processing pipeline that seamlessly combines speech recognition with speaker identification through the NVIDIA Riva integrated capabilities. The container handles audio preprocessing, including format conversion and segmentation, while ASR and speaker diarization processes run concurrently on the same audio stream. Results are automatically aligned using overlapping time segments, with each transcribed segment receiving appropriate speaker labels (for example, Speaker_0, Speaker_1). The inference handler processes audio files through the complete pipeline, initializing both ASR and speaker diarization services, running them in parallel, and aligning transcription segments with speaker labels. The output includes the full transcription, timestamped segments with speaker attribution, confidence scores, and total speaker count in a structured JSON format. 
Implementation and deployment 
The implementation extends NVIDIA parakeet-1-1b-ctc-en-us NIM container as the foundation, adding a Python aiohttp server that seamlessly manages the complete NIM lifecycle by automatically starting and monitoring the service. The server handles protocol adaptation by translating SageMaker inference requests to appropriate NIM APIs, implements the intelligent routing logic that analyzes request characteristics, and provides comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages and fallback mechanisms for robust production deployment. The containerized solution streamlines deployment through standard Docker and AWS CLI commands, featuring a pre-configured Docker file with the necessary dependencies and optimizations. The system accepts multiple input formats including multipart form-data (recommended for maximum compatibility), JSON with base64 encoding for simple integration scenarios, and raw binary uploads for direct audio processing. 
For detailed implementation instructions and working examples, teams can reference the complete implementation and deployment notebook in the AWS samples repository, which provides comprehensive guidance on deploying Parakeet ASR with NIM on SageMaker AI using the bring your own container (BYOC) approach. For organizations with specific architectural preferences, separate HTTP-only and gRPC-only implementations are also available, providing simpler deployment models for teams with well-defined use cases while the combined implementation offers maximum flexibility and automatic optimization. 
AWS customers can deploy these models either as production-grade NVIDIA NIM containers directly from SageMaker Marketplace or JumpStart, or open source NVIDIA models available on Hugging Face, which can be deployed through custom containers on SageMaker or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). This allows organizations to choose between fully managed, enterprise-tier endpoints with auto-scaling and security, or flexible open-source development for research or constrained use cases. 
Using an AWS LMI container 
LMI containers are designed to simplify hosting large models on AWS. These containers include optimized inference engines like vLLM, FasterTransformer, or TensorRT-LLM that can automatically handle things like model parallelism, quantization, and batching for large models. The LMI container is essentially a pre-configured Docker image that runs an inference server (for example a Python server with these optimizations) and allows you to specify model parameters by using environment variables. 
To use the LMI container for Parakeet, we would typically: 
 
 Choose the appropriate LMI image: AWS provides different LMI images for different frameworks. For Parakeet , we might use the DJLServing image for efficient inference. Alternatively, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server (which Riva uses) is an option if we package the model in ONNX or TensorRT format. 
 Specify the model configuration: With LMI, we often provide a model_id (if pulling from Hugging Face Hub) or a path to our model, along with configuration for how to load it (number of GPUs, tensor parallel degree, quantization bits). The container then downloads the model and initializes it with the specified settings. We can also download our own model files from Amazon S3 instead of using the Hub. 
 Define the inference handler: The LMI container might require a small handler script or configuration to tell it how to process requests. For ASR, this might involve reading the audio input, passing it to the model, and returning text. 
 
AWS LMI containers deliver high performance and scalability through advanced optimization techniques, including continuous batching, tensor parallelism, and state-of-the-art quantization methods. LMI containers integrate multiple inference backends (vLLM, TensorRT-LLM through a single unified configuration), helping users seamlessly experiment and switch between frameworks to find the optimal performance stack for your specific use case. 
Using a SageMaker PyTorch container 
SageMaker offers PyTorch Deep Learning Containers (DLCs) that come with PyTorch and many common libraries pre-installed. In this example, we demonstrated how to extend our prebuilt container to install necessary packages for the model. You can download the model directly from Hugging Face during the endpoint creation or download the Parakeet model artifacts, packaging it with necessary configuration files into a model.tar.gz archive, and uploading it to Amazon S3. Along with the model artifacts, an inference.py script is required as the entry point script to define model loading and inference logic, including audio preprocessing and transcription handling. When using the SageMaker Python SDK to create a PyTorchModel, the SDK will automatically repackage the model archive to include the inference script under /opt/ml/model/code/inference.py, while keeping model artifacts in /opt/ml/model/ on the endpoint. Once the endpoint is deployed successfully, it can be invoked through the predict API by sending audio files as byte streams to get transcription results. 
For the SageMaker real-time endpoint, we currently allow a maximum of 25MB for payload size. Make sure you have set up the container to also allow the maximum request size. However, if you are planning to use the same model for the asynchronous endpoint, the maximum file size that the async endpoint supports is 1GB and the response time is up to 1 hour. Accordingly, you should setup the container to be prepared for this payload size and timeout. When using the PyTorch containers, here are some key configuration parameters to consider: 
 
 SAGEMAKER_MODEL_SERVER_WORKERS: Set the number of torch workers that will load the number of models copied into GPU memory. 
 TS_DEFAULT_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT: Set the time out setting for Torch server workers; for long audio processing, you can set it to a higher number 
 TS_MAX_REQUEST_SIZE: Set the byte size values for requests to 1G for async endpoints. 
 TS_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE: Set the byte size values for response. 
 
In the example notebook, we also showcase how to leverage the SageMaker local session provided by the SageMaker Python SDK. It helps you create estimators and run training, processing, and inference jobs locally using Docker containers instead of managed AWS infrastructure, providing a fast way to test and debug your machine learning scripts before scaling to production. 
CDK pipeline prerequisites 
Before deploying this solution, make sure you have: 
 
 AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions ‚Äì Installation Guide 
 AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) installed ‚Äì Installation Guide

 Docker ‚Äì Installation Guide 
 SageMaker endpoint deployed with your ML model (Parakeet ASR models or similar) 
 Amazon SNS topics created for success and failure notifications 
 
CDK pipeline setup 
The solution deployment begins with provisioning the necessary AWS resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. AWS CDK creates the foundational components including: 
 
 DynamoDB Table: Configured for on-demand capacity to track invocation metadata, processing status, and results 
 S3 Buckets: Secure storage for input audio files, transcription outputs, and summarization results 
 SNS topics: Separate queues for success and failure event handling

 IAM roles and policies: Appropriate permissions for cross-service communication and resource access 
 
Environment setup 
Clone the repository and install dependencies: 
 
 # Install degit, a library for downloading specific sub directories
npm install -g degit

# Clone just the specific folder
npx degit aws-samples/genai-ml-platform-examples/infrastructure/automated-speech-recognition-async-pipeline-sagemaker-ai/sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk

# Navigate to folder
cd sagemaker-async-batch-inference-cdk

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Set up Python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

  vim bin/aws-blog-sagemaker.ts 

# Change the endpoint name 
sageMakerConfig: { 
    endpointName: 'your-sagemaker-endpoint-name',     
    enableSageMakerAccess: true 
} 
  
 
If you have followed the notebook to deploy the endpoint, you should have created the two SNS topics. Otherwise, make sure you create the correct SNS topics using CLI: 
 
 # Create SNS topics
aws sns create-topic --name success-inf
aws sns create-topic --name failed-inf 
 
Build and deploy 
Before you deploy the AWS CloudFormation template, make sure Docker is running. 
 
 # Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
npx cdk bootstrap

# Deploy the stack
npx cdk deploy 
 
Verify deployment 
After successful deployment, note the output values: 
 
 DynamoDB table name for status tracking 
 Lambda function ARNs for processing and status updates 
 SNS topic ARNs for notifications 
 
Submit audio file for processing 
Processing Audio Files 
Update the upload_audio_invoke_lambda.sh 
 
 LAMBDA_ARN="YOUR_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_ARN"
S3_BUCKET="YOUR_S3_BUCKET_ARN" 
 
Run the Script: 
AWS_PROFILE=default ./scripts/upload_audio_invoke_lambda.sh 
This script will: 
 
 Download a sample audio file 
 Upload the audio file to your s3 bucket 
 Send the bucket path to Lambda and trigger the transcription and summarization pipeline 
 
Monitoring progress 
You can check the result in DynamoDB table using the following command: 
 
 aws dynamodb scan --table-name YOUR_DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME 
 
Check processing status in the DynamoDB table: 
 
 submitted: Successfully queued for inference 
 completed: Transcription completed successfully 
 failed: Processing encountered an error 
 
Audio processing and workflow orchestration 
The core processing workflow follows an event-driven pattern: 
Initial processing and metadata extraction: When audio files are uploaded to S3, the triggered Lambda function analyzes the file metadata, validates format compatibility, and creates detailed invocation records in DynamoDB. This facilitates comprehensive tracking from the moment audio content enters the system. 
Asynchronous Speech Recognition: Audio files are processed through the SageMaker endpoint using optimized ASR models. The asynchronous process can handle various file sizes and durations without timeout concerns. Each processing request is assigned a unique identifier for tracking purposes. 
Success path processing: Upon successful transcription, the system automatically initiates the summarization workflow. The transcribed text is sent to Amazon Bedrock, where advanced language models generate contextually appropriate summaries based on configurable parameters such as summary length, focus areas, and output format. 
Error handling and recovery: Failed processing attempts trigger dedicated Lambda functions that log detailed error information, update processing status, and can initiate retry logic for transient failures. This robust error handling results in minimal data loss and provides clear visibility into processing issues. 
Real-world applications 
Customer service analytics: Organizations can process thousands of customer service call recordings to generate transcriptions and summaries, enabling sentiment analysis, quality assurance, and insights extraction at scale. 
Meeting and conference processing: Enterprise teams can automatically transcribe and summarize meeting recordings, creating searchable archives and actionable summaries for participants and stakeholders. 
Media and content processing: Media companies can process podcast episodes, interviews, and video content to generate transcriptions and summaries for improved accessibility and content discoverability. 
Compliance and legal documentation: Legal and compliance teams can process recorded depositions, hearings, and interviews to create accurate transcriptions and summaries for case preparation and documentation. 
Cleanup 
Once you have used the solution, remove the SageMaker endpoints to prevent incurring additional costs. You can use the provided code to delete real-time and asynchronous inference endpoints, respectively: 
 
 # Delete real-time inference
endpointreal_time_predictor.delete_endpoint()

# Delete asynchronous inference
endpointasync_predictor.delete_endpoint() 
 
You should also delete all the resources created by the CDK stack. 
 
 # Delete CDK Stack
cdk destroy 
 
Conclusion 
The integration of powerful NVIDIA speech AI technologies with AWS cloud infrastructure creates a comprehensive solution for large-scale audio processing. By combining Parakeet ASR‚Äôs industry-leading accuracy and speed with NVIDIA Riva‚Äôs optimized deployment framework on the Amazon SageMaker asynchronous inference pipeline, organizations can achieve both high-performance speech recognition and cost-effective scaling. The solution leverages the managed services of AWS (SageMaker AI, Lambda, S3, and Bedrock) to create an automated, scalable pipeline for processing audio content. With features like auto scaling to zero, comprehensive error handling, and real-time monitoring through DynamoDB, organizations can focus on extracting business value from their audio content rather than managing infrastructure complexity.
