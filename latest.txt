‚Ä¢ GPT-5 is here. Now what?
  At long last, OpenAI has released GPT-5. The new system abandons the distinction between OpenAI‚Äôs flagship models and its o series of reasoning models, automatically routing user queries to a fast nonreasoning model or a slower reasoning version. It is now available to everyone through the ChatGPT web interface‚Äîthough nonpaying users may need to wait a few days to gain full access to the new capabilities.&nbsp;



It‚Äôs tempting to compare GPT-5 with its explicit predecessor, GPT-4, but the more illuminating juxtaposition is with o1, OpenAI‚Äôs first reasoning model, which was released last year. In contrast to GPT-5‚Äôs broad release, o1 was initially available only to Plus and Team subscribers. Those users got access to a completely new kind of language model‚Äîone that would ‚Äúreason‚Äù through its answers by generating additional text before providing a final response, enabling it to solve much more challenging problems than its nonreasoning counterparts.





Whereas o1 was a major technological advancement, GPT-5 is, above all else, a refined product. During a press briefing, Sam Altman compared GPT-5 to Apple‚Äôs Retina displays, and it‚Äôs an apt analogy, though perhaps not in the way that he intended. Much like an unprecedentedly crisp screen, GPT-5 will furnish a more pleasant and seamless user experience. That‚Äôs not nothing, but it falls far short of the transformative AI future that Altman has spent much of the past year hyping. In the briefing, Altman called GPT-5 ‚Äúa significant step along the path to AGI,‚Äù or artificial general intelligence, and maybe he‚Äôs right‚Äîbut if so, it‚Äôs a very small step.



Take the demo of the model‚Äôs abilities that OpenAI showed to MIT Technology Review in advance of its release. Yann Dubois, a post-training lead at OpenAI, asked GPT-5 to design a web application that would help his partner learn French so that she could communicate more easily with his family. The model did an admirable job of following his instructions and created an appealing, user-friendly app. But when I gave GPT-4o an almost identical prompt, it produced an app with exactly the same functionality. The only difference is that it wasn‚Äôt as aesthetically pleasing.



Some of the other user-experience improvements are more substantial. Having the model rather than the user choose whether to apply reasoning to each query removes a major pain point, especially for users who don‚Äôt follow LLM advancements closely.&nbsp;



And, according to Altman, GPT-5 reasons much faster than the o-series models. The fact that OpenAI is releasing it to nonpaying users suggests that it‚Äôs also less expensive for the company to run. That‚Äôs a big deal: Running powerful models cheaply and quickly is a tough problem, and solving it is key to reducing AI‚Äôs environmental impact.¬†



OpenAI has also taken steps to mitigate hallucinations, which have been a persistent headache. OpenAI‚Äôs evaluations suggest that GPT-5 models are substantially less likely to make incorrect claims than their predecessor models, o3 and GPT-4o. If that advancement holds up to scrutiny, it could help pave the way for more reliable and trustworthy agents. ‚ÄúHallucination can cause real safety and security issues,‚Äù says Dawn Song, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley. For example, an agent that hallucinates software packages could download malicious code to a user‚Äôs device.



GPT-5 has achieved the state of the art on several benchmarks, including a test of agentic abilities and the coding evaluations SWE-Bench and Aider Polyglot. But according to Cl√©mentine Fourrier, an AI researcher at the company HuggingFace, those evaluations are nearing saturation, which means that current models have achieved close to maximal performance.&nbsp;



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically like looking at the performance of a high schooler on middle-grade problems,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIf the high schooler fails, it tells you something, but if it succeeds, it doesn‚Äôt tell you a lot.‚Äù Fourrier said she would be impressed if the system achieved a score of 80% or 85% on SWE-Bench‚Äîbut it only managed a 74.9%.&nbsp;



Ultimately, the headline message from OpenAI is that GPT-5 feels better to use. ‚ÄúThe vibes of this model are really good, and I think that people are really going to feel that, especially average people who haven&#8217;t been spending their time thinking about models,‚Äù said Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT.



Vibes alone, however, won‚Äôt bring about the automated future that Altman has promised. Reasoning felt like a major step forward on the way to AGI. We‚Äôre still waiting for the next one.
‚Ä¢ The Download: how AI is improving itself, and hidden greenhouse gases
  This is today&#8217;s edition of¬†The Download,¬†our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology.



Five ways that AI is learning to improve itself



Last week, Mark Zuckerberg declared that Meta aims to achieve smarter-than-human AI. He seems to have a recipe for achieving that goal, and the first ingredient is human talent: Zuckerberg has reportedly tried to lure top researchers to Meta Superintelligence Labs with nine-figure offers.&nbsp;



The second ingredient is AI itself.&nbsp; Zuckerberg recently said on an earnings call that Meta will focus on building self-improving AI‚Äîsystems that can bootstrap themselves to higher and higher levels of performance. He hopes to tap into a very real trend. Here are five ways that AI is already making itself better.

The greenhouse gases we&#8217;re not accounting for



Back in 2021, climate scientists noticed that levels of methane had soared in the atmosphere the previous year, rising at the fastest rate on record despite the global covid-19 lockdowns.



Researchers eventually spotted a clear pattern: Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer.The findings offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on.&nbsp;



There&#8217;s now a major endeavor underway to better track and understand what&#8217;s going on. Read our story about it.

‚Ä¢ The greenhouse gases we‚Äôre not accounting for
  In the spring of 2021, climate scientists were stumped.&nbsp;



The global economy was just emerging from the covid-19 lockdowns, but for some reason the levels of methane‚Äîa greenhouse gas emitted mainly through agriculture and fossil-fuel production‚Äîhad soared in the atmosphere the previous year, rising at the fastest rate on record.



Researchers around the world set to work unraveling the mystery, reviewing readings from satellites, aircraft, and greenhouse-gas monitoring stations. They eventually spotted a clear pattern: Methane emissions had increased sharply across the tropics, where wetlands were growing wetter and warmer.&nbsp;



That created the ideal conditions for microbes that thrive in anaerobic muck, which gobbled up more of the carbon-rich organic matter and spat out more methane as a by-product. (Reduced pollution from nitrogen oxides, which help to break down methane in the atmosphere, also likely played a substantial role.)



The findings offer one of the clearest cases so far where climate change itself is driving additional greenhouse-gas emissions from natural systems, triggering a feedback effect that threatens to produce more warming, more emissions, and on and on.&nbsp;



There are numerous additional ways this is happening or soon could, including wildfires and thawing permafrost. These are major emissions sources that aren‚Äôt included in the commitments nations have made under the Paris climate agreement‚Äîand climate risks that largely aren‚Äôt accounted for in the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs most recent warming scenarios.



Spark Climate Solutions (not to be confused with this newsletter) hopes to change that.The San Francisco nonprofit is launching what‚Äôs known as a model intercomparison project, in which different research teams run the same set of experiments on different models across a variety of emissions scenarios to determine how climate change could play out. This one would specifically explore how a range of climate feedback effects could propel additional warming, additional emissions, and additional types of feedback.



‚ÄúThese increased emissions from natural sources add to human emissions and amplify climate change,‚Äù says Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, who previously served as climate science advisor to President Joe Biden. ‚ÄúAnd if you don‚Äôt look at all of them together, you can‚Äôt quantify the strength of that feedback effect.‚Äù



Other participants in the effort will include scientists at the Environmental Defense Fund, Stanford University, the Woodwell Climate Research Center, and other institutions in Europe and Australia, according to Spark Climate Solutions.



The nonprofit hopes to publish the findings in time for them to be incorporated into the UN climate panel‚Äôs seventh major assessment report, which is just getting underway, to help ensure that these dangers are more fully represented. That, in turn, would give nations a more accurate sense of the world‚Äôs carbon budgets, or the quantity of greenhouse gases they can produce before the planet reaches temperatures 1.5 ¬∞C or&nbsp; 2 ¬∞C over preindustrial levels.&nbsp;



But one thing is already clear: Since the current scenarios don‚Äôt fully account for these feedback effects, the world will almost certainly warm faster than is now forecast, which underscores the importance of carrying out this exercise.&nbsp;



Scientists at EDF, Woodwell and other institutions found that fires in the world‚Äôs northernmost forests, thawing permafrost and warming tropical wetlands could together push the planet beyond 2 ¬∞C years faster, eliminating up to a quarter of the time left before the world passes the core goal of the Paris agreement, in a paper under review.&nbsp;



Earlier this year, Spark Climate Solutions set up a broader program to advance research and awareness of what‚Äôs known as warming-induced emissions, which will launch additional collaborations similar to the modeling intercomparison project.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The goal of the program and the research project is ‚Äúto really mainstream the inclusion of this topic in climate science and climate policy, and to drive research around climate solutions,‚Äù says Ben Poulter, who leads the program at Spark Climate Solutions and was previously a scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.



Spark notes that warming temperatures could also release more carbon dioxide from the oceans, in a process known as outgassing; additional carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective ozone layer, from farmland; more carbon dioxide and methane from wildfires; and still more of all three of these gases as permafrost thaws.



The ground remains frozen year round across a vast expanse of the Northern Hemisphere, creating a frosty underground storehouse from Alaska to Siberia that‚Äôs packed with twice as much carbon as the atmosphere.



But as it thaws, it starts to decompose and release greenhouse gases, says Susan Natali, an Arctic climate scientist focused on permafrost at Woodwell. A study published in Nature in January noted that 30% of the world‚Äôs Arctic‚ÄìBoreal Zone has already flipped from a carbon sink to a carbon source, when wildfires, thawing permafrost and other factors are taken into account.



Despite these increasing risks, only a minority of the models that fed into the UN climate panel‚Äôs last major report incorporated the feedback effects of thawing permafrost. And the emissions risks still weren‚Äôt fully accounted for because these ecosystems are difficult to monitor and model, Natali says.Among the complexities: Wildfires, which are themselves hard to predict, can accelerate thawing. It‚Äôs also hard to foresee which regions will grow drier or wetter, which determines whether they release mostly methane or carbon dioxide‚Äîand those gases have very different warming effects over different time periods. There are counterbalancing effects that must be taken into account as well‚Äîfor instance, as carbon-absorbing plants replace ice and snow in certain areas.



Natali says improving our understanding of these complex feedback effects is essential to understanding the dangers we face.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to mean additional costs to human health, human life,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe want people to be safe‚Äîand it‚Äôs very hard to do that if you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs coming and you‚Äôre not prepared for it.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Five ways that AI is learning to improve itself
  Last week, Mark Zuckerberg declared that Meta is aiming to achieve smarter-than-human AI. He seems to have a recipe for achieving that goal, and the first ingredient is human talent: Zuckerberg has reportedly tried to lure top researchers to Meta Superintelligence Labs with nine-figure offers. The second ingredient is AI itself.&nbsp; Zuckerberg recently said on an earnings call that Meta Superintelligence Labs will be focused on building self-improving AI‚Äîsystems that can bootstrap themselves to higher and higher levels of performance.



The possibility of self-improvement distinguishes AI from other revolutionary technologies. CRISPR can‚Äôt improve its own targeting of DNA sequences, and fusion reactors can‚Äôt figure out how to make the technology commercially viable. But LLMs can optimize the computer chips they run on, train other LLMs cheaply and efficiently, and perhaps even come up with original ideas for AI research. And they‚Äôve already made some progress in all these domains.



According to Zuckerberg, AI self-improvement could bring about a world in which humans are liberated from workaday drudgery and can pursue their highest goals with the support of brilliant, hypereffective artificial companions. But self-improvement also creates a fundamental risk, according to Chris Painter, the policy director at the AI research nonprofit METR. If AI accelerates the development of its own capabilities, he says, it could rapidly get better at hacking, designing weapons, and manipulating people. Some researchers even speculate that this positive feedback cycle could lead to an ‚Äúintelligence explosion,‚Äù in which AI rapidly launches itself far beyond the level of human capabilities.



But you don‚Äôt have to be a doomer to take the implications of self-improving AI seriously. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all include references to automated AI research in their AI safety frameworks, alongside more familiar risk categories such as chemical weapons and cybersecurity. ‚ÄúI think this is the fastest path to powerful AI,‚Äù says Jeff Clune, a professor of computer science at the University of British Columbia and senior research advisor at Google DeepMind. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs probably the most important thing we should be thinking about.‚Äù





By the same token, Clune says, automating AI research and development could have enormous upsides. On our own, we humans might not be able to think up the innovations and improvements that will allow AI to one day tackle prodigious problems like cancer and climate change.



For now, human ingenuity is still the primary engine of AI advancement; otherwise, Meta would hardly have made such exorbitant offers to attract researchers to its superintelligence lab. But AI is already contributing to its own development, and it‚Äôs set to take even more of a role in the years to come. Here are five ways that AI is making itself better.



1. Enhancing productivity



Today, the most important contribution that LLMs make to AI development may also be the most banal. ‚ÄúThe biggest thing is coding assistance,‚Äù says Tom Davidson, a senior research fellow at Forethought, an AI research nonprofit. Tools that help engineers write software more quickly, such as Claude Code and Cursor, appear popular across the AI industry: Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed in October 2024 that a quarter of the company‚Äôs new code was generated by AI, and Anthropic recently documented a wide variety of ways that its employees use Claude Code. If engineers are more productive because of this coding assistance, they will be able to design, test, and deploy new AI systems more quickly.



But the productivity advantage that these tools confer remains uncertain: If engineers are spending large amounts of time correcting errors made by AI systems, they might not be getting any more work done, even if they are spending less of their time writing code manually. A recent study from METR found that developers take about 20% longer to complete tasks when using AI coding assistants, though Nate Rush, a member of METR‚Äôs technical staff who co-led the study, notes that it only examined extremely experienced developers working on large code bases. Its conclusions might not apply to AI researchers who write up quick scripts to run experiments.



Conducting a similar study within the frontier labs could help provide a much clearer picture of whether coding assistants are making AI researchers at the cutting edge more productive, Rush says‚Äîbut that work hasn‚Äôt yet been undertaken. In the meantime, just taking software engineers‚Äô word for it isn‚Äôt enough: The developers METR studied thought that the AI coding tools had made them work more efficiently, even though the tools had actually slowed them down substantially.



2. Optimizing infrastructure



Writing code quickly isn‚Äôt that much of an advantage if you have to wait hours, days, or weeks for it to run. LLM training, in particular, is an agonizingly slow process, and the most sophisticated reasoning models can take many minutes to generate a single response. These delays are major bottlenecks for AI development, says Azalia Mirhoseini, an assistant professor of computer science at Stanford University and senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind. ‚ÄúIf we can run AI faster, we can innovate more,‚Äù she says.



That‚Äôs why Mirhoseini has been using AI to optimize AI chips. Back in 2021, she and her collaborators at Google built a non-LLM AI system that could decide where to place various components on a computer chip to optimize efficiency. Although some other researchers failed to replicate the study‚Äôs results, Mirhoseini says that Nature investigated the paper and upheld the work‚Äôs validity‚Äîand she notes that Google has used the system‚Äôs designs for multiple generations of its custom AI chips.



More recently, Mirhoseini has applied LLMs to the problem of writing kernels, low-level functions that control how various operations, like matrix multiplication, are carried out in chips. She‚Äôs found that even general-purpose LLMs can, in some cases, write kernels that run faster than the human-designed versions.



Elsewhere at Google, scientists built a system that they used to optimize various parts of the company‚Äôs LLM infrastructure. The system, called AlphaEvolve, prompts Google‚Äôs Gemini LLM to write algorithms for solving some problem, evaluates those algorithms, and asks Gemini to improve on the most successful‚Äîand repeats that process several times. AlphaEvolve designed a new approach for running datacenters that saved 0.7% of Google‚Äôs computational resources, made further improvements to Google‚Äôs custom chip design, and designed a new kernel that sped up Gemini‚Äôs training by 1%.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



That might sound like a small improvement, but at a huge company like Google it equates to enormous savings of time, money, and energy. And Matej Balog, a staff research scientist at Google DeepMind who led the AlphaEvolve project, says that he and his team tested the system on only a small component of Gemini‚Äôs overall training pipeline. Applying it more broadly, he says, could lead to more savings.



3. Automating training



LLMs are famously data hungry, and training them is costly at every stage. In some specific domains‚Äîunusual programming languages, for example‚Äîreal-world data is too scarce to train LLMs effectively. Reinforcement learning with human feedback, a technique in which humans score LLM responses to prompts and the LLMs are then trained using those scores, has been key to creating models that behave in line with human standards and preferences, but obtaining human feedback is slow and expensive.&nbsp;



Increasingly, LLMs are being used to fill in the gaps. If prompted with plenty of examples, LLMs can generate plausible synthetic data in domains in which they haven‚Äôt been trained, and that synthetic data can then be used for training. LLMs can also be used effectively for reinforcement learning: In an approach called ‚ÄúLLM as a judge,‚Äù LLMs, rather than humans, are used to score the outputs of models that are being trained. That approach is key to the influential ‚ÄúConstitutional AI‚Äù framework proposed by Anthropic researchers in 2022, in which one LLM is trained to be less harmful based on feedback from another LLM.



Data scarcity is a particularly acute problem for AI agents. Effective agents need to be able to carry out multistep plans to accomplish particular tasks, but examples of successful step-by-step task completion are scarce online, and using humans to generate new examples would be pricey. To overcome this limitation, Stanford‚Äôs Mirhoseini and her colleagues have recently piloted a technique in which an LLM agent generates a possible step-by-step approach to a given problem, an LLM judge evaluates whether each step is valid, and then a new LLM agent is trained on those steps. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not limited by data anymore, because the model can just arbitrarily generate more and more experiences,‚Äù Mirhoseini says.



4. Perfecting agent design



One area where LLMs haven‚Äôt yet made major contributions is in the design of LLMs themselves. Today‚Äôs LLMs are all based on a neural-network structure called a transformer, which was proposed by human researchers in 2017, and the notable improvements that have since been made to the architecture were also human-designed.&nbsp;



But the rise of LLM agents has created an entirely new design universe to explore. Agents need tools to interact with the outside world and instructions for how to use them, and optimizing those tools and instructions is essential to producing effective agents. ‚ÄúHumans haven‚Äôt spent as much time mapping out all these ideas, so there‚Äôs a lot more low-hanging fruit,‚Äù Clune says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to just create an AI system to go pick it.‚Äù



Together with researchers at the startup Sakana AI, Clune created a system called a ‚ÄúDarwin G√∂del Machine‚Äù: an LLM agent that can iteratively modify its prompts, tools, and other aspects of its code to improve its own task performance. Not only did the Darwin G√∂del Machine achieve higher task scores through modifying itself, but as it evolved, it also managed to find new modifications that its original version wouldn‚Äôt have been able to discover. It had entered a true self-improvement loop.



5. Advancing research



Although LLMs are speeding up numerous parts of the LLM development pipeline, humans may still remain essential to AI research for quite a while. Many experts point to ‚Äúresearch taste,‚Äù or the ability that the best scientists have to pick out promising new research questions and directions, as both a particular challenge for AI and a key ingredient in AI development.&nbsp;



But Clune says research taste might not be as much of a challenge for AI as some researchers think. He and Sakana AI researchers are working on an end-to-end system for AI research that they call the ‚ÄúAI Scientist.‚Äù It searches through the scientific literature to determine its own research question, runs experiments to answer that question, and then writes up its results.



One paper that it wrote earlier this year, in which it devised and tested a new training strategy aimed at making neural networks better at combining examples from their training data, was anonymously submitted to a workshop at the International Conference on Machine Learning, or ICML‚Äîone of the most prestigious conferences in the field‚Äîwith the consent of the workshop organizers. The training strategy didn‚Äôt end up working, but the paper was scored highly enough by reviewers to qualify it for acceptance (it is worth noting that ICML workshops have lower standards for acceptance than the main conference). In another instance, Clune says, the AI Scientist came up with a research idea that was later independently proposed by a human researcher on X, where it attracted plenty of interest from other scientists.



‚ÄúWe are looking right now at the GPT-1 moment of the AI Scientist,‚Äù Clune says. ‚ÄúIn a few short years, it is going to be writing papers that will be accepted at the top peer-reviewed conferences and journals in the world. It will be making novel scientific discoveries.‚Äù



Is superintelligence on its way?



With all this enthusiasm for AI self-improvement, it seems likely that in the coming months and years, the contributions AI makes to its own development will only multiply. To hear Mark Zuckerberg tell it, this could mean that superintelligent models, which exceed human capabilities in many domains, are just around the corner. In reality, though, the impact of self-improving AI is far from certain.



It‚Äôs notable that AlphaEvolve has sped up the training of its own core LLM system, Gemini‚Äîbut that 1% speedup may not observably change the pace of Google‚Äôs AI advancements. ‚ÄúThis is still a feedback loop that‚Äôs very slow,‚Äù says Balog, the AlphaEvolve researcher. ‚ÄúThe training of Gemini takes a significant amount of time. So you can maybe see the exciting beginnings of this virtuous [cycle], but it‚Äôs still a very slow process.‚Äù



If each subsequent version of Gemini speeds up its own training by an additional 1%, those accelerations will compound. And because each successive generation will be more capable than the previous one, it should be able to achieve even greater training speedups‚Äînot to mention all the other ways it might devise to improve itself. Under such circumstances, proponents of superintelligence argue, an eventual intelligence explosion looks inevitable.



This conclusion, however, ignores a key observation: Innovation gets harder over time. In the early days of any scientific field, discoveries come fast and easy. There are plenty of obvious experiments to run and ideas to investigate, and none of them have been tried before. But as the science of deep learning matures, finding each additional improvement might require substantially more effort on the part of both humans and their AI collaborators. It‚Äôs possible that by the time AI systems attain human-level research abilities, humans or less-intelligent AI systems will already have plucked all the low-hanging fruit.



Determining the real-world impact of AI self-improvement, then, is a mighty challenge. To make matters worse, the AI systems that matter most for AI development‚Äîthose being used inside frontier AI companies‚Äîare likely more advanced than those that have been released to the general public, so measuring o3‚Äôs capabilities might not be a great way to infer what‚Äôs happening inside OpenAI.



But external researchers are doing their best‚Äîby, for example, tracking the overall pace of AI development to determine whether or not that pace is accelerating. METR is monitoring advancements in AI abilities by measuring how long it takes humans to do tasks that cutting-edge systems can complete themselves. They‚Äôve found that the length of tasks that AI systems can complete independently has, since the release of GPT-2 in 2019, doubled every seven months.&nbsp;



Since 2024, that doubling time has shortened to four months, which suggests that AI progress is indeed accelerating. There may be unglamorous reasons for that: Frontier AI labs are flush with investor cash, which they can spend on hiring new researchers and purchasing new hardware. But it‚Äôs entirely plausible that AI self-improvement could also be playing a role.



That‚Äôs just one indirect piece of evidence. But Davidson, the Forethought researcher, says there‚Äôs good reason to expect that AI will supercharge its own advancement, at least for a time. METR‚Äôs work suggests that the low-hanging-fruit effect isn‚Äôt slowing down human researchers today, or at least that increased investment is effectively counterbalancing any slowdown. If AI notably increases the productivity of those researchers, or even takes on some fraction of the research work itself, that balance will shift in favor of research acceleration.



‚ÄúYou would, I think, strongly expect that there‚Äôll be a period when AI progress speeds up,‚Äù Davidson says. ‚ÄúThe big question is how long it goes on for.‚Äù

üîí Cybersecurity & Privacy
‚Ä¢ KrebsOnSecurity in New ‚ÄòMost Wanted‚Äô HBO Max Series
  A new documentary series about cybercrime airing next month on HBO Max features interviews with Yours Truly. The four-part series follows the exploits of Julius Kivim√§ki, a prolific Finnish hacker recently convicted of leaking tens of thousands of patient records from an online psychotherapy practice while attempting to extort the clinic and its patients.
The documentary, &#8220;Most Wanted: Teen Hacker,&#8221; explores the 27-year-old Kivim√§ki&#8217;s lengthy and increasingly destructive career, one that was marked by cyber attacks designed to result in real-world physical impacts on their targets.

By the age of 14, Kivim√§ki had fallen in with a group of criminal hackers who were mass-compromising websites and milking them for customer payment card data. Kivim√§ki and his friends enjoyed harassing and terrorizing others by &#8220;swatting&#8221; their homes &#8212; calling in fake hostage situations or bomb threats at a target&#8217;s address in the hopes of triggering a heavily-armed police response to that location.
On Dec. 26, 2014, Kivim√§ki and fellow members of a group of online hooligans calling themselves the Lizard Squad launched a massive distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against the Sony Playstation and Microsoft Xbox Live platforms, preventing millions of users from playing with their shiny new gaming rigs the day after Christmas. The Lizard Squad later acknowledged that the stunt was planned to call attention to their new DDoS-for-hire service, which came online and started selling subscriptions shortly after the attack.
Finnish investigators said Kivim√§ki also was responsible for a 2014 bomb threat against former Sony Online Entertainment President John Smedley that grounded an American Airlines plane. That incident was widely reported to have started with a Twitter post from the Lizard Squad, after Smedley mentioned some upcoming travel plans online. But according to Smedley and Finnish investigators, the bomb threat started with a phone call from Kivim√§ki.
Julius &#8220;Zeekill&#8221; Kivimaki, in December 2014.
The creaky wheels of justice seemed to be catching up with Kivim√§ki in mid-2015, when a Finnish court found him guilty of more than 50,000 cybercrimes, including data breaches, payment fraud, and operating a global botnet of hacked computers. Unfortunately, the defendant was 17 at the time, and received little more than a slap on the wrist: A two-year suspended sentence and a small fine.
Kivim√§ki immediately bragged online about the lenient sentencing, posting on Twitter that he was an &#8220;untouchable hacker god.&#8221; I wrote a column in 2015 lamenting his laughable punishment because it was clear even then that this was a person who enjoyed watching other people suffer, and who seemed utterly incapable of remorse about any of it. It was also abundantly clear to everyone who investigated his crimes that he wasn&#8217;t going to quit unless someone made him stop.
In response to some of my early reporting that mentioned Kivim√§ki, one reader shared that they had been dealing with non-stop harassment and abuse from Kivim√§ki for years, including swatting incidents, unwanted deliveries and subscriptions, emails to her friends and co-workers, as well as threatening phonecalls and texts at all hours of the night. The reader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, shared that Kivim√§ki at one point confided that he had no reason whatsoever for harassing her &#8212; that she was picked at random and that it was just something he did for laughs.
Five years after Kivim√§ki&#8217;s conviction, the Vastaamo Psychotherapy Center¬†in Finland became the target of blackmail when a tormentor identified as ‚Äúransom_man‚Äù demanded payment of 40 bitcoins (~450,000 euros at the time) in return for a promise not to publish highly sensitive therapy session notes Vastaamo had exposed online.
Ransom_man, a.k.a. Kivim√§ki, announced on the dark web that he would start publishing 100 patient profiles every 24 hours. When Vastaamo declined to pay, ransom_man shifted to extorting individual patients. According to Finnish police, some 22,000 victims reported extortion attempts targeting them personally, targeted emails that threatened to publish their therapy notes online unless paid a 500 euro ransom.
In October 2022, Finnish authorities charged Kivim√§ki with extorting Vastaamo and its patients. But by that time he was on the run from the law and living it up across Europe, spending lavishly on fancy cars, apartments and a hard-partying lifestyle.
In February 2023, Kivim√§ki was arrested in France¬†after authorities there responded to a domestic disturbance call and found the defendant sleeping off a hangover on the couch of a woman he‚Äôd met the night before. The French police grew suspicious when the 6‚Ä≤ 3‚Ä≥ blonde, green-eyed man presented an ID that stated he was of Romanian nationality.
A redacted copy of an ID Kivimaki gave to French authorities claiming he was from Romania.
In April 2024, Kivim√§ki was sentenced to more than six years in prison after being convicted of extorting Vastaamo and its patients.
The documentary is directed by the award-winning Finnish producer and director Sami Kieski and co-written by Joni Soila. According to an August 6 press release, the four 43-minute episodes will drop weekly on Fridays throughout September across Europe, the U.S, Latin America, Australia and South-East Asia.
‚Ä¢ Who Got Arrested in the Raid on the XSS Crime Forum?
  On July 22, 2025, the European police agency Europol said a long-running investigation led by the French Police resulted in the arrest of a 38-year-old administrator of XSS,¬†a Russian-language cybercrime forum with more than 50,000 members. The action has triggered an ongoing frenzy of speculation and panic among XSS denizens about the identity of the unnamed suspect, but the consensus is that he is a pivotal figure in the crime forum scene who goes by the hacker handle &#8220;Toha.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a deep dive on what&#8217;s knowable about Toha, and a short stab at who got nabbed.
An unnamed 38-year-old man was arrested in Kiev last month on suspicion of administering the cybercrime forum XSS. Image: ssu.gov.ua.
Europol did not name the accused, but published partially obscured photos of him from the raid on his residence in Kiev. The police agency said the suspect acted as a trusted third party &#8212; arbitrating disputes between criminals &#8212; and guaranteeing the security of transactions on XSS. A statement from Ukraine&#8217;s SBU security service said XSS counted among its members many cybercriminals from various ransomware groups, including REvil, LockBit, Conti, and Qiliin.
Since the Europol announcement, the XSS forum resurfaced at a new address on the deep web (reachable only via the anonymity network Tor). But from reviewing the recent posts, there appears to be little consensus among longtime members about the identity of the now-detained XSS administrator.
The most frequent comment regarding the arrest was a message of solidarity and support for Toha, the handle chosen by the longtime administrator of XSS and several other major Russian forums. Toha&#8217;s accounts on other forums have been silent since the raid.
Europol said the suspect has enjoyed a nearly 20-year career in cybercrime, which roughly lines up with Toha&#8217;s history. In 2005, Toha was a founding member of the Russian-speaking forum Hack-All. That is, until it got massively hacked a few months after its debut. In 2006, Toha rebranded the forum to exploit[.]in, which would go on to draw tens of thousands of members, including an eventual Who&#8217;s-Who of wanted cybercriminals.
Toha announced in 2018 that he was selling the Exploit forum, prompting rampant speculation on the forums that the buyer was secretly a Russian or Ukrainian government entity or front person. However, those suspicions were unsupported by evidence, and Toha vehemently denied the forum had been given over to authorities.
One of the oldest Russian-language cybercrime forums was DaMaGeLaB, which operated from 2004 to 2017, when its administrator &#8220;Ar3s&#8221; was arrested. In 2018, a partial backup of the DaMaGeLaB forum was reincarnated as xss[.]is, with Toha as its stated administrator.
CROSS-SITE GRIFTING
Clues about Toha&#8217;s early presence on the Internet &#8212; from ~2004 to 2010 &#8212; are available in the archives of Intel 471, a cyber intelligence firm that tracks forum activity. Intel 471 shows Toha used the same email address across multiple forum accounts, including at Exploit, Antichat, Carder[.]su and inattack[.]ru.
DomainTools.com finds Toha&#8217;s email address &#8212; toschka2003@yandex.ru &#8212; was used to register at least a dozen domain names &#8212; most of them from the mid- to late 2000s. Apart from exploit[.]in and a domain called ixyq[.]com, the other domains registered to that email address end in .ua, the top-level domain for Ukraine (e.g. deleted.org[.]ua, lj.com[.]ua, and blogspot.org[.]ua).
A 2008 snapshot of a domain registered to toschka2003@yandex.ru and to Anton Medvedovsky in Kiev. Note the message at the bottom left, &#8220;Protected by Exploit,in.&#8221; Image: archive.org.
Nearly all of the domains registered to toschka2003@yandex.ru contain the name Anton Medvedovskiy in the registration records, except for the aforementioned ixyq[.]com, which is registered to the name Yuriy Avdeev in Moscow.
This Avdeev surname came up in a lengthy conversation with Lockbitsupp, the leader of the rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate group Lockbit. The conversation took place in February 2024, when Lockbitsupp asked for help identifying Toha&#8217;s real-life identity.
In early 2024, the leader of the Lockbit ransomware group &#8212; Lockbitsupp &#8212; asked for help investigating the identity of the XSS administrator Toha, which he claimed was a Russian man named Anton Avdeev.
Lockbitsupp didn&#8217;t share why he wanted Toha&#8217;s details, but he maintained that Toha&#8217;s real name was Anton Avdeev. I declined to help Lockbitsupp in whatever revenge he was planning on Toha, but his question made me curious to look deeper.
It appears Lockbitsupp&#8217;s query was based on a now-deleted Twitter post from 2022, when a user by the name &#8220;3xp0rt&#8221; asserted that Toha was a Russian man named Anton Viktorovich Avdeev, born October 27, 1983.
Searching the web for Toha&#8217;s email address toschka2003@yandex.ru reveals a 2010 sales thread on the forum bmwclub.ru where a user named Honeypo was selling a 2007 BMW X5. The ad listed the contact person as Anton Avdeev and gave the contact phone number 9588693.

A search on the phone number 9588693 in the breach tracking service Constella Intelligence finds plenty of official Russian government records with this number, date of birth and the name Anton Viktorovich Avdeev. For example, hacked Russian government records show this person has a Russian tax ID and SIN (Social Security number), and that they were flagged for traffic violations on several occasions by Moscow police; in 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2014.
Astute readers may have noticed by now that the ages of Mr. Avdeev (41) and the XSS admin arrested this month (38) are a bit off. This would seem to suggest that the person arrested is someone other than Mr. Avdeev, who did not respond to requests for comment.
A FLY ON THE WALL
For further insight on this question, KrebsOnSecurity sought comments from Sergeii Vovnenko, a former cybercriminal from Ukraine who now works at the security startup paranoidlab.com. I reached out to Vovnenko because for several years beginning around 2010 he was the owner and operator of thesecure[.]biz, an encrypted &#8220;Jabber&#8221; instant messaging server that Europol said was operated by the suspect arrested in Kiev. Thesecure[.]biz grew quite popular among many of the top Russian-speaking cybercriminals because it scrupulously kept few records of its users&#8217; activity, and its administrator was always a trusted member of the community.
The reason I know this historic tidbit is that in 2013, Vovnenko &#8212; using the hacker nicknames &#8220;Fly,&#8221; and &#8220;Flycracker&#8221; &#8212; hatched a plan to have a gram of heroin purchased off of the Silk Road darknet market and shipped to our home in Northern Virginia. The scheme was to spoof a call from one of our neighbors to the local police, saying this guy Krebs down the street was a druggie who was having narcotics delivered to his home.
I happened to be lurking on Flycracker&#8217;s private cybercrime forum when his heroin-framing plan was carried out, and called the police myself before the smack eventually arrived in the U.S. Mail. Vovnenko was later arrested for unrelated cybercrime activities, extradited to the United States, convicted, and deported after a 16-month stay in the U.S. prison system [on several occasions, he has expressed heartfelt apologies for the incident, and we have since buried the hatchet].
Vovnenko said he purchased a device for cloning credit cards from Toha in 2009, and that Toha shipped the item from Russia. Vovnenko explained that he (Flycracker) was the owner and operator of thesecure[.]biz from 2010 until his arrest in 2014.
Vovnenko believes thesecure[.]biz was stolen while he was in jail, either by Toha and/or an XSS administrator who went by the nicknames N0klos and Sonic.
&#8220;When I was in jail, [the] admin of xss.is stole that domain, or probably N0klos bought XSS from Toha or vice versa,&#8221; Vovnenko said of the Jabber domain. &#8220;Nobody from [the forums] spoke with me after my jailtime, so I can only guess what really happened.&#8221;
N0klos was the owner and administrator of an early Russian-language cybercrime forum known as Darklife[.]ws. However, N0kl0s also appears to be a lifelong Russian resident, and in any case seems to have vanished from Russian cybercrime forums several years ago.
Asked whether he believes Toha was the XSS administrator who was arrested this month in Ukraine, Vovnenko maintained that Toha is Russian, and that &#8220;the French cops took the wrong guy.&#8221;
WHO IS TOHA?
So who did the Ukrainian police arrest in response to the investigation by the French authorities? It seems plausible that the BMW ad invoking Toha&#8217;s email address and the name and phone number of a Russian citizen was simply misdirection on Toha&#8217;s part &#8212; intended to confuse and throw off investigators. Perhaps this even explains the Avdeev surname surfacing in the registration records from one of Toha&#8217;s domains.
But sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one. &#8220;Toha&#8221; is a common Slavic nickname for someone with the first name &#8220;Anton,&#8221; and that matches the name in the registration records for more than a dozen domains tied to Toha&#8217;s toschka2003@yandex.ru email address: Anton Medvedovskiy.
Constella Intelligence finds there is an Anton Gannadievich Medvedovskiy living in Kiev who will be 38 years old in December. This individual owns the email address itsmail@i.ua, as well an an Airbnb account featuring a profile photo of a man with roughly the same hairline as the suspect in the blurred photos released by the Ukrainian police. Mr. Medvedovskiy did not respond to a request for comment.
My take on the takedown is that the Ukrainian authorities likely arrested Medvedovskiy. Toha shared on DaMaGeLab in 2005 that he had recently finished the 11th grade and was studying at a university &#8212; a time when Mevedovskiy would have been around 18 years old. On Dec. 11, 2006, fellow Exploit members wished Toha a happy birthday. Records exposed in a 2022 hack at the Ukrainian public services portal diia.gov.ua show that Mr. Medvedovskiy&#8217;s birthday is Dec. 11, 1987.
The law enforcement action and resulting confusion about the identity of the detained has thrown the Russian cybercrime forum scene into disarray in recent weeks, with lengthy and heated arguments about XSS&#8217;s future spooling out across the forums.
XSS relaunched on a new Tor address shortly after the authorities plastered their seizure notice on the forum&#8217;s¬† homepage, but all of the trusted moderators from the old forum were dismissed without explanation. Existing members saw their forum account balances drop to zero, and were asked to plunk down a deposit to register at the new forum. The new XSS &#8220;admin&#8221; said they were in contact with the previous owners and that the changes were to help rebuild security and trust within the community.
However, the new admin&#8217;s assurances appear to have done little to assuage the worst fears of the forum&#8217;s erstwhile members, most of whom seem to be keeping their distance from the relaunched site for now.
Indeed, if there is one common understanding amid all of these discussions about the seizure of XSS, it is that Ukrainian and French authorities now have several years worth of private messages between XSS forum users, as well as contact rosters and other user data linked to the seized Jabber server.
&#8220;The myth of the &#8216;trusted person&#8217; is shattered,&#8221; the user &#8220;GordonBellford&#8221; cautioned on Aug. 3 in an Exploit forum thread about the XSS admin arrest. &#8220;The forum is run by strangers. They got everything. Two years of Jabber server logs. Full backup and forum database.&#8221;
GordonBellford continued:
And the scariest thing is: this data array is not just an archive. It is material for analysis that has ALREADY BEEN DONE . With the help of modern tools, they see everything:
Graphs of your contacts and activity.
Relationships between nicknames, emails, password hashes and Jabber ID.
Timestamps, IP addresses and digital fingerprints.
Your unique writing style, phraseology, punctuation, consistency of grammatical errors, and even typical typos that will link your accounts on different platforms.
They are not looking for a needle in a haystack. They simply sifted the haystack through the AI sieve and got ready-made dossiers.

‚Ä¢ Reimagining healthcare delivery and public health with AI
  In November 2022, OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT kick-started a new era in AI. This was followed less than a half year later by the release of GPT-4. In the months leading up to GPT-4‚Äôs public release, Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research, cowrote a book full of optimism for the potential of advanced AI models to transform the world of healthcare. What has happened since? In this special podcast series, The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited, Lee revisits the book, exploring how patients, providers, and other medical professionals are experiencing and using generative AI today while examining what he and his coauthors got right‚Äîand what they didn‚Äôt foresee.&nbsp;



In this episode, healthcare leaders Dr. Umair Shah (opens in new tab) and Dr. Gianrico Farrugia (opens in new tab) join Lee to discuss AI‚Äôs impact on the business of public health and healthcare delivery, the healthcare-research connection, and the patient experience. Shah, a healthcare strategic consultant and former state secretary of health, explores the role of public health in the larger ecosystem and why it might not get the attention it needs or deserves and how AI could be leveraged to assist in data analysis, to help better engage with people on matters of public health, and to help narrow gaps between care delivery and public health responses during health emergencies. Farrugia, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic, traces AI‚Äôs path from predictive to generative and discusses how that progress has helped usher in a new healthcare architecture for Mayo Clinic and its partners, one powered by the goal of longer, healthier lives for patients, and how AI is also changing Mayo Clinic‚Äôs research and the education it provides, including the offering of masters and PhDs in AI and other emerging technologies.&nbsp;

PETER LEE: ‚ÄúIn US healthcare, quality ratings are increasingly used to tie the improvement in patient health outcomes to the reimbursement rates that healthcare providers can receive. The ability of GPT-4 to understand these systems and give concrete advice ‚Ä¶ has a chance to make it easier for providers to achieve success in both dimensions.‚Äù&nbsp;

[THEME MUSIC]



This is The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited. I‚Äôm your host, Peter Lee. 



Shortly after OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 was publicly released, Carey Goldberg, Dr. Zak Kohane, and I published The AI Revolution in Medicine to help educate the world of healthcare and medical research about the transformative impact this new generative AI technology could have. But because we wrote the book when GPT-4 was still a secret, we had to speculate. Now, two years later, what did we get right, and what did we get wrong? 



In this series, we‚Äôll talk to clinicians, patients, hospital administrators, and others to understand the reality of AI in the field and where we go from here.



				
				
					



[THEME MUSIC FADES]&nbsp;



The book passage I read at the top is from Chapter 7, ‚ÄúThe Ultimate Paperwork Shredder.‚Äù 



Public health officials and healthcare system leaders influence the well-being and health of people at the population level. They help shape people‚Äôs perceptions and responses to public health emergencies, as well as to chronic disease. They help determine the type, quality, and availability of treatment. All this is critical for maintaining good public health, as well as aligning better health and financial outcomes. That, of course, is the main goal of the concept of value-based care. AI can definitely have significant ramifications for achieving this.&nbsp;



Joining us today to talk about how leaders in public health and healthcare systems are thinking about and acting on this new generation of AI is Dr. Umair Shah and Dr. Gianrico Farrugia.&nbsp;



Dr. Umair Shah is a nationally recognized health leader and innovator. He led one of America‚Äôs top-rated pandemic responses as Washington State‚Äôs secretary of health, a position he held from 2020 to 2025. Umair previously directed Harris County Public Health in Texas, overseeing large-scale emergency response for the nation‚Äôs third-largest county, while building an emergency-care career spanning 20-plus years. He now advises organizations on health innovation and strategy as founder and principal of Rickshaw Health.&nbsp;



Dr. Gianrico Farrugia is the president and CEO of Mayo Clinic, the world&#8217;s top-ranked hospital for seven consecutive years, and a pioneer in technology-forward, platform-based healthcare. Under his leadership, Mayo has built and deployed the Mayo Clinic Platform. The platform enables Mayo and its partners to gain practical insights from a comprehensive repository of longitudinal de-identified clinical data spanning four continents. Gianrico is also a Mayo Clinic physician and professor and an author.&nbsp;



Umair and Gianrico are CEO-level leaders representing some of the best of the worlds of public health, healthcare delivery, medical research, and medical education.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]&nbsp;



Here is my interview with Dr. Umair Shah:&nbsp;



LEE: Umair, it&#8217;s really great to have you here.&nbsp;



UMAIR SHAH: Peter, it&#8217;s my pleasure. I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this conversation, and I hope you are well today.&nbsp;



LEE: [LAUGHS] I am doing extremely well.



So, you know, what I&#8217;d like to do in these conversations is first just to start, a little bit about you.



SHAH: Sure.&nbsp;



LEE: You served actually during a really tumultuous time as the secretary of health in the State of Washington. But you recently stepped away from that and you started your own firm, Rickshaw Health. So can we start there? What&#8217;s that all about?&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah, no, absolutely. First of all, you know, I would say that the transition from Texas to Washington could not have been more geopolitically different, [LAUGHTER] as you can imagine.



LEE: Sure.&nbsp;



SHAH: You know, if you like the red-blue paradigms, you couldn‚Äôt be more, you know, red and you couldn‚Äôt be more blue, I think.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



SHAH: But what happened is, back in November this past year, as I saw some of the playout of continuation of this red-blue dynamic, I made the decision to step down. And Jan. 15, I stepped down, as you mentioned, and I spent some time really thinking about what I wanted to do next and was looking at a number of opportunities.&nbsp;



And then a moment in time, there were some things happening in our‚Äîmy wife and our family&#8217;s personal lives that sort of made me think that I wanted to focus a little bit more on family. And I felt the universe was saying, ‚ÄúStay still.‚Äù [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



And I launched Rickshaw Health (opens in new tab) and the notion that, as you know, Peter, rickshaws are oftentimes known across the globe as these modes of transport that reliably get you through ever-changing streets and traffic patterns and all sorts of ecosystems that are evolving at all times. And they get you to the other side and they get you also with a sense of exhilaration. Like when I took my boys to Karachi, and we were‚Äîyou know, they jumped in a rickshaw and the, you know, open air [LAUGHTER] and they felt this incredible excitement.&nbsp;



And so Rickshaw Health was speaking to the three wheels of a rickshaw that symbolize the three children that we have and the real notion of how do we bring balance and agility and performance to the forefront and then move in an ever‚Äîjust like streets‚Äîever-changing healthcare environment that is constantly evolving, and we too must evolve with it. And that&#8217;s what Rickshaw Health is all about, is taking clients to that next level of trying to navigate, especially at this time, a very, very different landscape than even several months ago. So, excited about it.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, absolutely. You know, you made this transition from Texas to the State of Washington. And for people who listen to this podcast and don&#8217;t know, the particular part of Texas where you were‚ÄîHarris County‚Äîis really big, very, very important in that state. That&#8217;s just not, you know, the normal county in Texas.&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



LEE: It&#8217;s actually ‚Ä¶ it&#8217;s actually known as quite a forward-looking place, technologically.&nbsp;



SHAH: That‚Äôs right.&nbsp;



LEE: So what was, you know, the transition like, then, going from, you know, possibly the most, sort of, maybe advanced county in the State of Texas, a large place, to the State of Washington?&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah, you know, Harris County is the third-largest county in the US. So it had close to five million. And now it&#8217;s probably ‚Ä¶ it&#8217;s exceeded the five million people, and a very diverse, very forward-looking, as you mentioned, technologically very, very much looking at what&#8217;s the next horizon, and home to Texas Medical Center [TMC] as well, which is ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ the largest medical center. Of course, it had to be Texas. So it can‚Äôt be the largest in the state or the country [LAUGHTER]‚Äîthe largest in the world, right.&nbsp;



And TMC also had a number of different initiatives related to startups and venture capital and VC. And so they had launched something called TMCX. And that was a real opportunity‚Äîand I know you&#8217;re familiar with it‚Äîan opportunity to really look at how do you incubate all sorts of different innovations and bringing private sector, public sector as well as healthcare delivery alongside these startups to really look at the landscape.&nbsp;



And so when I left Houston and came to Washington, I realized that obviously, I was in the backyard ‚Ä¶ I mean, you know, you all at Microsoft Research and the work that you&#8217;re all doing is part of an ecosystem of advanced innovation that&#8217;s occurring in the Pacific Northwest that, you know, when we see all the players that are here, all the, you know, ones that do so many different things, but they&#8217;re doing them with an eye towards technology, advancements, and adoptions, it&#8217;s been quite amazing.&nbsp;



When I made that transition, it was really about, you know, the vaccines and what was happening with, you know, with COVID and fighting the‚Äîyou know, remember, this was the state that had the first case in the continental United States, had the first outbreak, and the first [lab-confirmed] death. And fast-forward a few years later, we had the fifth-lowest death rate in the US. And that was because we all came together to do so much.



LEE: Yeah, well maybe that gets us into a question that I ask a lot of our guests, which is, you know, and maybe let&#8217;s, since we&#8217;re on your time as the secretary of health in Washington State, [start] with that job. I ask, how would you explain to your mother what you do every day?&nbsp;



SHAH: [LAUGHS] I laugh because that&#8217;s been such a fascinating conversation in public health because we have oftentimes been‚Äîit&#8217;s been really hard to describe what that is.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: And, you know, there are so many metaphors and, you know, analogies that we&#8217;ve used. I&#8217;ve always wondered why we do not have more television shows or sitcoms or dramas that are about the public health workforce or the work that we do in the field, because you have, you know, all sorts of healthcare delivery ones, right.&nbsp;



LEE: Yup.&nbsp;



SHAH: As a practicing physician for 20 years, I realized that people knew what doctors did; they knew what nurses did, right. They intimately touch the healthcare system.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



SHAH: They understood, you know, that an ambulance picks you up at your home or somewhere else, transports you ‚Ä¶ gets you to the emergency department. The emergency department, they do some things to you or within the four walls of that ER, and then you&#8217;re either admitted, sent home, and several days, weeks, whatever later, you get home if you&#8217;re admitted, and you start your, you know, post-hospital stay at home or your rehab or what have you. And that all is known to people.&nbsp;



But when you ask your mother, your grandmother, or your, you know, your uncle, or your brother, your neighbor, your coworker about what is public health, they have a very quizzical look on their face of what that is.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: And so what I&#8217;ve ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: You know, just one thing I&#8217;ve learned is: it&#8217;s not just all the people you mentioned. Even healthcare professionals sometimes have that quizzical look.&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah, good point. That&#8217;s right. Good point. And a lot of it is because we don&#8217;t get exposed to it or trained in it. You know, we think about public health when we&#8217;re in our training. And, you know, I&#8217;m sure you had a very similar piece of this is that, you know, you see it as, oh, that&#8217;s the health department that takes care of, you know, STDs, or it takes care, you know, it does the immunizations, or, you know, maybe they do some water quality, or maybe they do mosquitoes [mosquito control], and things like that. But the reality is, we do all of those things and more.&nbsp;



So my metaphor has been that we are the offensive line of a football team, and the healthcare delivery is the quarterback. So everybody focuses on, you know, from a few years back, everybody knows Tom Brady, right.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



SHAH: He won the Super Bowls, everybody knows what ‚Ä¶ but if you asked people who was number 75 on the offensive line of the New England Patriots ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ or name your favorite football team. And the answer would be: you would not be able to likely answer that question. You would know Tom Brady, the quarterback, and that&#8217;s healthcare delivery, the ER doc or the hospitalist or the nurse or the, you know, the medical assistant, or the people that are doing all the work in the field that are the ones that are more visible, but the invisible workforce of the offensive line, that&#8217;s who we don&#8217;t know. And yet these are the people that are blocking and sweating and doing all things to complement the work and make sure the quarterback is successful.&nbsp;



And here&#8217;s where the metaphor breaks down, that when Tom Brady wins the Super Bowl, we continue to invest in the offensive line because we recognize the value of it and we want the quarterback to be successful the next season. But in public health or in society, we do the exact opposite.&nbsp;



When tuberculosis rates come down, we say, well, you know what? We&#8217;ve solved the problem; we don&#8217;t need it anymore.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: Or you have another, you know, environmental issue that&#8217;s no longer there, you say, ‚ÄúWe don&#8217;t need it anymore.‚Äù And we disinvest from public health or that offensive line. And then you start to see those rates go back up.&nbsp;



And so my answer to Mom and Grandma and Dad and Grandpa is we are critical to your health because we touch you every single day. And so please invest in us.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. And, you know, I think I&#8217;m going to want to get a little deeper on that in just a few minutes here, because, I think especially during the pandemic, that issue of not understanding the importance of that offensive lineman actually really came to the forefront.&nbsp;



And so I&#8217;d like to get into that. But the, kind of, second, kind of, standard thing I&#8217;ve been probing with people is still just focusing on you and your background is what touchpoints or experiences you&#8217;ve had with AI in the past.&nbsp;



And not everyone has. Like, it maybe isn&#8217;t too surprising that doctors and healthcare developers, tech developers, have lots of contact with AI, but would the top dog, you know, at a public health agency ever have had significant contact with AI? What about you?&nbsp;



SHAH: You know, it&#8217;s interesting. Several years ago, I was in the audience with the [then] FEMA director, [Rich Serino], who just did such an incredible job. And I remember he made this comment at that time. And, Peter, this may have been like ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚ÄîI&#8217;m dating myself‚Äî10, 15, maybe even 20 years ago, and he said, ‚ÄúEverybody in the audience, there&#8217;s this, you know, app called Twitter.‚Äù And, you know, ‚ÄúHow many people in the audience have ever sent a tweet or know about this?‚Äù And I don&#8217;t know, maybe‚Äîit was a public health audience‚Äîmaybe about 15% of the people raised their hands.&nbsp;



He said, ‚ÄúI challenge you to right now, pick up your phone, download the app, and go ahead and send a tweet right now.‚Äù&nbsp;



And I remember I sent my first tweet at that time. And it was so thought provoking for me was that he was saying you need to be engaged in social media, but the other 85% of the audience had not even done that or had ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ even understood the importance of social media at that time. Or maybe they understood, but they had restrictions on how to utilize, right.&nbsp;



So that has stayed with me because that&#8217;s very much about this revolution of AI that I know that public health and population health practitioners like myself who have been in the trenches and understand the importance of it, they really believe in the importance or think they know the importance.&nbsp;



But NACCHO, the National Association of County and City Health Officials, had done a survey of local health agencies. And about two-thirds, if not three-quarters, of local health agencies reported that they had an AI capacity that was low or lower than ideal.&nbsp;



LEE: Hmm. Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: And that is very much where I come from. When I was in public sector and at the state health agency, our transformation was very much about how do we advance the work, and how do we utilize this in a population health standpoint?&nbsp;



And I was fortunate to have a chief of innovation at Washington State Department of Health, Les Becker, who understood the value of AI. And as you know, we did also hold a AI science convening that ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yep. Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ your team was there with University of Washington. And that was really an opportunity for us to say that AI is here. It&#8217;s not tomorrow. It&#8217;s not next year. It&#8217;s not the future. It&#8217;s already here. We need to embrace it.&nbsp;



But here&#8217;s the problem, Peter, far too few people in our field understand just how to embrace it.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: So I have become a markedly more champion of AI. One, since I read your book. So I think there‚Äôs that. So thank you for writing it. But two, since I really recognize that when I became a solo or a primary-few practitioner in my own realm, I needed to force-amplify the work that I was doing.&nbsp;



And when I look back, and I continue to stay in touch with my colleagues in the field of public health, what they&#8217;re also struggling with is that you have an epidemiologist who&#8217;s got a mound of information‚Äîdata, statistics, etc.‚Äîthat they are going through, and they&#8217;re doing everything in their power to get that processed and analyzed.&nbsp;



LEE: Yep. Yep.&nbsp;



SHAH: AI can take 80% of that and do it. And that epidemiologist can now turn to more of an overseer and a gatekeeper and to really recognize the patterns ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yep.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ and let AI be able to do the, you know, grunt work. And similarly, as you know, measles‚Äîwith the outbreaks that we&#8217;ve seen, especially in Texas but elsewhere‚Äîyou&#8217;ve got an opportunity where our communications people who are saying, ‚ÄúLook, we&#8217;re about to have, or we know we&#8217;re about to announce that there&#8217;s a measles outbreak in, you know, in our community or our state or what have you‚Äîour region.‚Äù&nbsp;



And they can have AI go through different press briefings and/or press releases and say, ‚ÄúGive me the state of the art on how I should communicate this message to the community.‚Äù&nbsp;



LEE: Hmm.&nbsp;



SHAH: And bam! You can do that. And now you can oversee that work, as well. And then the third example is that we are always looking at how do we find ways to have a deeper connection with those who come to our, you know, our websites or come to our engagement tools‚Äîwith bots and things like that. AI can really accelerate that work, as well. So there&#8217;s so many use cases that AI has for population health or public health.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: But I think the challenge is that we just don&#8217;t have enough adoption because they&#8217;re ‚Ä¶ one, we&#8217;ve had funding cuts, but two is that there is this real hesitation on, what is it that we can do? And I argue‚Äîthe last thing I&#8217;ll say about this, Peter‚Äîis that I argue that AI is happening right now. The discussions, the technology advancements, the work, the policy work, all that&#8217;s happening right now. If public health practitioners are not at the table, if they&#8217;re not part of the, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ &#8220;What does this look like? How does it work in our field?&#8221; &#8230; guess what? It&#8217;s going to be done to us and for us rather than with us. And if we do not get with that and get to the table, then unfortunately it may not be exactly what we want it to be at the end of the day.&nbsp;



LEE: I find it really interesting that you are using the terms ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù and ‚Äúpopulation health‚Äù ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah.&nbsp;



LEE: ‚Ä¶ pretty much interchangeably here. And I think that that&#8217;s something that I think touches on an assumption that was both implicit and explicit in the book that we wrote, which is: we were making some predictions that our ability to extract insights and knowledge from population health data would be enhanced through the use of AI. And I think that it looks to me like that has been more challenging and has come along more slowly over the past two years. But what is your view?&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah, I think part of, and I think you and I have had this conversation, you know, in bits and pieces. I think one of the real challenges is that when even tech companies, and you can name all of them, when they look at what they&#8217;re doing in the AI space, they gravitate towards healthcare delivery.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



SHAH: Right? That&#8217;s, it&#8217;s ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: And in fact, it&#8217;s not even delivery. I think techies‚ÄîI did this, too‚Äîtend to gravitate specifically to diagnosis.&nbsp;



SHAH: Yes, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. You know, I think that&#8217;s a really good point. And, you know, when you look at sepsis or you look at pneumonia or try to figure out ways that, you know, radiologists or x-rays or CT scans can be read, it&#8217;s, I mean, there are so many use cases that are within the healthcare sector. And I think that gets back to this inequity that we have when we look at population health or, you know, this broad, um, swath of land that is, oftentimes, left behind or unexplored, and you have healthcare delivery. Now, healthcare delivery we know gets 95 cents or 96 cents of every dollar. So it makes sense why, right. But we also know that, at the end of the day, we&#8217;re looking at value-based outcomes, and you cannot be successful in the healthcare delivery system unless we are truly looking at prevention and what&#8217;s happening in the community and the population.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: And that&#8217;s why I use it interchangeably, but I know that ‚Äúpublic health‚Äù has got a very specific term, and ‚Äúpopulation health‚Äù is a different set of ways of looking at the world. The reason that people try to shy away from pop health in essence is that you could talk about population health as being my population of patients in a clinic. It could be my health systems population. It could be an insurance company saying, these are the lives covered, right. So it becomes, what is population? When we think of public health, we think of the entirety of the population, right. In the State of Washington, eight million people. Harris County, five million people. Or in the US, 300‚Äîwhatever the number of millions of people that‚Äîwe think of the entire population. And what is it that actually impacts the health and well-being of that population is really what that&#8217;s about.&nbsp;



Yet here&#8217;s the challenge. When we then talk to those of our partners and our colleagues in the tech field, there are two things happening. One is, there&#8217;s a motivation because of the amount of dollars that are in [the] healthcare sector. And number two is, because it&#8217;s more familiar, right.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: And so there are very few practitioners similar to me that are out there, that are in the pop health who kind of know healthcare delivery because they&#8217;ve also seen patients, but they&#8217;re also‚Äîthey worked at that federal, state, local level, community level‚Äîthey&#8217;ve, you know, they&#8217;ve done you know various different kinds of environments.&nbsp;



And they say, ‚ÄúLook, I&#8217;ve got a perspective to really help a tech company or somebody see the rest of it,‚Äù but you have to have both partners coming together to see that. And I think that&#8217;s one of the real challenges that we have.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



And so now I&#8217;m going to want to go into specific problems, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah. Sure.&nbsp;



LEE: ‚Ä¶ and maybe COVID is a good thing to focus on‚Äîthe breadth of problems that had to get solved in pandemic response and where the gaps between healthcare delivery and public health were really exposed.&nbsp;



And so the first problem that I remember really keenly that just seemed so vexing was understanding where the PPE was, the personal protective equipment &#8230;&nbsp;



SHAH: Hmm. Yeah.&nbsp;



LEE: ‚Ä¶ and where it needed to be.&nbsp;



SHAH: Yes.&nbsp;



LEE: And so that turned out ‚Ä¶ you would think just getting masks and gowns and gloves to the right places at the right times or even understanding where they are so that, you know ‚Ä¶ and being able to predict, you know, what hospitals, what clinics are most likely to get a big influx of patients during the height of the pandemic would be something that would be straightforward to solve, but that turned out to be an extremely difficult problem.&nbsp;



But how did it look from where you were sitting? Because you were sitting at the helm having to deal with these problems.&nbsp;



SHAH: Yeah, we were constantly chasing data and information. And oftentimes, you know, because a lot of these data systems in the public health sector have been underinvested in over the decades, then, you know, you had our biggest emergency crisis of our time, and a lot of public health agencies were either getting, you know, thrown a whole host of resources or had to create things on the fly.&nbsp;



And whether that was at Harris County or in the State of Washington, I will tell you that what I saw was that, you know, a lot of agencies across the country were still using fax machines, you know, to get data that were coming in.&nbsp;



And I remember actually‚Äîit&#8217;s kind of a funny story‚Äîthere was a fax machine that was highlighted down in our agency in Texas. And we actually had this fax machine, had mounds of, you know, data ‚Ä¶ sorry, papers that were next to ‚Ä¶ faxes that were coming in and all these things.&nbsp;



And you would have, you know, Mr. Peter Lee listed as a patient. And then the next, you know, transmission would have Pete Lee. And then the next transmission would have Peter Lee, but instead of L-E-E, it was L-E-A-H or something, or L-I or something, right. And it was just ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: &#8230; or you had a date of birth missing, or you had, you know, an address that was off. And what we realized is that over time, a lot of the data that were coming in were just incomplete data, and being able to chase that was really hard.&nbsp;



And so, you know, I think AI has that potential to really organize it, and to stratify it, and to especially get you to a point of at least cleaning it up. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just that AI ‚Ä¶ AI doesn&#8217;t just save time; it saves lives. Truly used ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Hmm. Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ that&#8217;s, I think, where we&#8217;re talking here.&nbsp;



And so when you have PPE and things of that nature, as you talked about, here in the State of Washington or what we were trying to do to get vaccines out or everything we&#8217;re doing to try to get communication messages to the public. And we did a fantastic job of that, although not ideal.&nbsp;



I mean, there are so many things that I could point to that we could have done better‚Äîall of us in the field of public health and healthcare delivery alike.&nbsp;



I will tell you that the one thing that stays with me is that if we had those tools then, and we had them in place then, and we had invested in them at that time in advance of, I think there was a real opportunity for us to be able to move ahead and even be better at how we affected the health outcomes of the very populations that we were trying to get to.&nbsp;



And I think it&#8217;s [that] AI allows us to shift from reactive to proactive systems, catching health issues before they escalate and allow us to really communicate with empathy at scale.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: And when we can do those things, whether it&#8217;s opioids or whether it&#8217;s, you know, something that&#8217;s happening related to an infectious disease, or, you know, even this, the new agenda with Make America Healthy Again‚Äîwhich by the way, as you know, we had a Be Well, WA &#8230; Be Well, Washington ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right. Yes.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ very much that was about, you know, looking at, you know, physical health and nutritional health and emotional well-being and social connectedness‚Äîthat there is a real opportunity for us to address the very drivers of ill health. And when we can do that, and AI can help us accelerate that, I think we truly have the ability to drive down costs and increase the value that&#8217;s returned to all of us.&nbsp;



LEE: What is your assessment of public health agencies‚Äô readiness to use technology like AI? Because if there&#8217;s one thing AI is good at, it&#8217;s predicting things. Are they [public health agencies] in a better position to predict things now?&nbsp;



SHAH: You know, I think it&#8217;s a tale of two cities.&nbsp;



I think on the one hand, we&#8217;re better because we have the tools. On the other hand, we&#8217;ve lost the capacity to be able to utilize those tools. So, you know, it&#8217;s a plus and a minus.&nbsp;



Many, many years ago, there was the buzzword of what we called syndromic surveillance. And, Peter, you know this term well.&nbsp;



It was like you would have, you know, a whole host of accumulation of data points in, let&#8217;s say, a hospital setting or an emergency department ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yup. Yup.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ where, you know, you‚Äôd have runny nose, you&#8217;d have cough, you&#8217;d have a fever, and you would take that, what was happening and people presenting to the emergency department, with what was happening in the area pharmacies where people were going to get Kleenexes and tissues ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yep.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ and buying over-the-counter, you know, medication, and things of that nature, Tylenol, etc.&nbsp;



And you would say ‚Ä¶ you would put those two things together, and you would come up with a quote-unquote ‚Äúsyndrome,‚Äù and you would say our ability to say there was an alert to that syndrome allows us to say something uh-oh is going on in the community, and we got many, many advancements related to wastewater surveillance over the last several years as you know ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yep. Yep. Well, also, wasn&#8217;t patient number one in the United States discovered also because of the Seattle Flu Study, or at least that sort of syndromic surveillance.&nbsp;



SHAH: That&#8217;s right.&nbsp;



LEE: They weren&#8217;t even looking for COVID. They were just taking, you know, snot samples from people.&nbsp;



SHAH: That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right.&nbsp;



And so that&#8217;s the kind of thing that you, you know, we underappreciate. Is you have to have a smart, intelligent, agile practitioner, right.&nbsp;



So if I think about down in Dallas when Ebola was, you know, the gentleman who was, you know, the index case for Ebola was sent out of the emergency department and came back several days later.&nbsp;



And it was the nurse who picked up this time because the practitioner, the provider, the healthcare provider, the doc missed it. And I wouldn&#8217;t want to say in a negative way. It was just, like, not obvious. You aren&#8217;t thinking of Ebola in the middle of Texas. And it was the nurse who picked up: there&#8217;s something wrong here.&nbsp;



And what AI has the ability to do is to pick up those symptoms &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ or those patterns and be able to recognize the importance of those and be able to then alert the practitioner. So what I ‚Ä¶ we call it artificial intelligence‚Äîit almost becomes artificial wisdom.&nbsp;



LEE: Hmm. Yeah, interesting. So that actually reminds me of my next question, which is another thing that I watched you and public health officials do is try to play ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù games.&nbsp;



So, for example, I think one decision you were involved in had to do with, you know, what would be the impact if we put a ban on large gatherings like concerts or movie theaters or imposed an 8 PM curfew on restaurants, and you were trying to play ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù games. Like, what would be the impact on the spread of the pandemic there?&nbsp;



So now, again, today with AI, would that aspect of what you did play out differently than it did during the pandemic?&nbsp;



SHAH: As you know, COVID was the most studied condition on the planet at one point. And it was, you know, things that usually we would learn over years or months, we were learning in weeks or days or hours.&nbsp;



And I remember in Houston, I would say something in the morning, and I would always try to give the caveat, ‚ÄúThis is the best information we know right now,‚Äù because it kept changing, whether it was around masks or whether it was around, you know, the way the virus was operating, whether it was around &#8230;&nbsp;



I remember even ‚Ä¶ I was just watching something recently where I was asked to comment about whether spiders could transmit COVID-19. You know, just questions that were just evolving, evolving, evolving. And the information was evolving. By morning, you would say something. By evening, it would change.&nbsp;



And why I say that is that it would have been great in the pandemic if we could have said, if you could give us all the information that&#8217;s happening across the globe, synthesize that information, and be able to help us forecast the right decisions that we should be making and help us model that information so we could decide: if you did a curfew, or if you did, you know, a mask, or if you could, you know, change something else related to policy‚Äîwhat are the impacts of it?&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: What we found constantly in public health was that we were weighing decisions in incomplete data, incomplete information.&nbsp;



So great now that everybody can armchair quarterback looking back three, five years ago and say, ‚ÄúI would have done it this way,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI would have done it that way.‚Äù Gosh, I would have as well. But guess what‚Äîwe didn&#8217;t have that information at that time. And so you had to make the best decisions you could with incomplete data.&nbsp;



But what AI has the potential to do is to help complete the incomplete data. Now, it&#8217;s not going to get 100%.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: And I think, Peter, you know, the one thing we&#8217;ve got to be really mindful [of] is phantom information, or information where it sort of makes up things, or may somehow get you incomplete information, or skews it a certain way.&nbsp;



This is why we can&#8217;t take the person out of it yet.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



SHAH: Now, maybe one day we can.&nbsp;



I&#8217;m not one of those Pollyanna-ish that people will never be replaced. I actually believe that those people who are skilled with AI and the tools will eventually have a competitive advantage over those who are not. Just like if I had a physician who knows how to use their smartphone or knows how to use a word processor or knows how to do a PowerPoint presentation is going to replace the ones that use scantrons &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;



SHAH: ‚Ä¶ or the ones that write it on pieces of paper‚Äîthat eventually it makes it more efficient and effective, but we&#8217;re not there yet. But I think that the potential is absolutely there.&nbsp;



LEE: So I have one more question. And you can, kind of, tell I&#8217;m trying to expand people&#8217;s understanding of just the incredible breadth of what goes on in public health, you know, all of these sorts of different issues.&nbsp;



And again, just sticking to COVID, but this is a much broader issue. Another thing you had to cope with were significant rise of misinformation ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



SHAH: Yes.&nbsp;



LEE: ‚Ä¶ and maybe going along with that, very, very significant inequities in outcomes in the COVID response. And when you think about AI there, I think you can argue it both ways, that it both exacerbates the problem but also gives you new tools to mitigate the problems.&nbsp;



What is your view?&nbsp;



SHAH: I think you ‚Ä¶ I don&#8217;t even have to say it ‚Ä¶ I think you hit on it, is that, you know, it really is two sides of one coin.&nbsp;



On the one hand, it has the power of really advancing and allowing us to move forward in a way that incredibly accelerates and accentuates, but on the other hand, in the case of inequities, right? So if you have inequitable information data that&#8217;s already out in the literature or already out in the, you know, media, or what have you, about a certain population or people or certain kinds of ideas or thoughts, etc., then AI will tend to accumulate that. You&#8217;re going to take that information, thinking that&#8217;s the best out there, but it may have missed out on information and now you go with it. And that&#8217;s a potential problem.&nbsp;



And I think it&#8217;s the same thing on information is that when we have people that are able to classify or misclassify information, I think it really becomes hard because it can accelerate the inequities of trust or inequities of trusted sources of information. It can also close the gap.&nbsp;



So I think, you know, it&#8217;s really up to us and this responsible AI to really think about how we can go about doing this in a way that&#8217;s going to allow us to further the advancements but also be careful of those, you know, those kind of places where we&#8217;re going to step into that are not going to be well received or successful.&nbsp;



You know, the one thing that&#8217;s really fascinating about this whole conversation is that this is why we&#8217;ve got to be at the table, Peter.&nbsp;



LEE: Yep. Yep.&nbsp;



SHAH: Because if we&#8217;re not at the table, you know, what&#8217;s the, you know, or if tech companies that are out there doing this work and aren&#8217;t even seeing a field of practitioners that are actually wrestling with the same problems but just cannot actually get to the solutions, we&#8217;re just going to continue to accentuate the problems.&nbsp;



And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a firm proponent of: we&#8217;ve got to be at the table.&nbsp;



And so even when we&#8217;ve seen in, and this is going to be a little controversial, but governmental spaces where, you know, policymakers have said, ‚ÄúLook, we are not going to let you do certain things,‚Äù or they say to public health practitioners or even healthcare delivery practitioners in certain spaces, ‚ÄúYou cannot even play with this. You cannot have it on your phones. You can&#8217;t do any &#8230; ‚Äù&nbsp;



You know, what I really believe it does is that it takes [an] almost like we put our head in the sand type of approach rather than saying, ‚ÄúWhat is it that we can do to help improve AI and make it work for all of us?‚Äù What we&#8217;re doing is we&#8217;re essentially saying, ‚ÄúWe&#8217;re going to let the tech companies and all the other developers come up with the solutions, but it&#8217;s not going to be informed by the people in the field.‚Äù And that&#8217;s dangerous. We have to do both. We have to be working together.&nbsp;



LEE: Umair, that&#8217;s really so well said, and I think a great way to wrap things up. I&#8217;ve certainly learned a lot from this conversation. So thank you again.&nbsp;



SHAH: It&#8217;s been a pleasure to be with you this morning. Thank you so much for the time. And I&#8217;m looking forward to further conversations.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]‚ÄØ



I live in the State of Washington and because of that, I&#8217;ve been able to watch Umair in action as our state&#8217;s former secretary of health. And some of that action was pretty intense to say the least because his tenure as secretary of health spanned the period of the COVID pandemic.&nbsp;



Now, as a dyed-in-the-wool techie, I have to admit that at the beginning, I don&#8217;t think I really understood the scope and importance of the field of public health. But as the conversation with Umair showed, it&#8217;s really important and it is arguably both an underfunded and underappreciated part of our healthcare system.&nbsp;



Now, public health is also very much an area that&#8217;s ripe for advancement and transformation through AI. As Umair explained in our discussion, the core of public health is the idea of population health, the idea of extracting new health insights from signals from population-scale data. And already we&#8217;re starting to see AI making a difference.&nbsp;



Now here&#8217;s my interview with Dr. Gianrico Farrugia.&nbsp;



LEE: Gianrico, it&#8217;s really great to have you here today.&nbsp;



GIANRICO FARRUGIA: Peter, thanks for having me. Thanks for making me part of your podcast.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, what I&#8217;d like to do in these conversations is, you know, we&#8217;ll definitely want to talk about the overall healthcare system, the state of healthcare, and what AI could or might do to help or even hurt all of that. But I always like to start with a sharper focus just on you specifically. And my first question always is, you know, I think people imagine what a hospital or a health system president and CEO does, but not really. And so how would you explain to your mother what you do every day?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So, Peter, my mother‚Äôs 88 years old. She lives in Malta, and she‚Äôs visiting at the moment, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Oh, wow.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ which is kind of nice, really.&nbsp;



LEE: Wow, that is amazing.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: I&#8217;m proud that she&#8217;s still proud of me. So she does ask. I&#8217;ll tell her the scope of Mayo Clinic. We serve patients across the globe. We have about 83,000 staff members that work with us, and we&#8217;re very proud of the work we do in research, education, and the practice.&nbsp;



Mayo Clinic is built to serve people with serious disease. So what I tell my mother is that here we are. We&#8217;re a healthcare organization that knows what it needs to do: keep patients as the North Star. The needs of the patient come first. We have 83,000 people who want to do that, several thousand physicians and scientists. My job is to look slightly ahead and then share what I&#8217;m seeing and then, sort of, smooth the way for others to make sure Mayo remains true to its mission but also true to the fact that at the moment, we are in a category of one. We need to remain there not just from an ego standpoint, but really from a ‚Äúdo good to the world‚Äù standpoint.&nbsp;



At that point, invariably my mother will tell me that I&#8217;m working too hard. [LAUGHTER] And then of course, I change the subject, and I ask her what she cooked today because my mother, who‚Äôs 88, cooks for the whole family in Malta, and there are usually four generations eating around the table. So I tell her what she does for the family is what I do for the Mayo family.&nbsp;



LEE: Wow, that&#8217;s a great way to put it. And it sounds like you actually have a good chance to have some good genes if she&#8217;s still that active at age 88.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: I think I chose a little more stressful job that may limit [that]. I will tell you very briefly is that one of the AI algorithms we have estimates biological age from an electrocardiogram. My biological age jumped by 3.7 years when I became CEO.&nbsp;



LEE: [LAUGHS] Oh no.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: I&#8217;m hoping it will reverse on the other side.&nbsp;



LEE: To stick with you just for one more moment here, second question I ask is about your origin story with respect to AI. And typically, for most people, there is AI before ChatGPT and generative AI and then after the generative AI revolution. So can you share a little bit about this? Because it must be the case that you&#8217;ve been thinking about this a long time since you&#8217;ve really led Mayo Clinic to be so tech forward in this way.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Well, I&#8217;ve been, as you said, a physician for way too long. I got my MD degree in ‚Äô87. So that sort of dates me. But it also means that I saw a lot of the promise for AI that never seemed to pan out for decades and decades and decades like you did.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Around 10 years ago, Mayo could sense that there was something different, that something was changing, that we actually‚Äîat that time, predictive AI‚Äîcould make a big difference. And I think that&#8217;s the moment where I and others jumped in and said Mayo Clinic needs to be involved.&nbsp;



And then about six years ago, when‚Äîsix and a half years ago‚ÄîI became CEO, it was clear that there was the right confluence of data, knowledge, tech expertise, that we could deal with what was increasingly bothering me, which is that we knew what was coming from a technology standpoint and we knew the current healthcare system could not deliver on what patients need and want within that current system. And so the answer is, how could a place like Mayo Clinic with our reputation not jump in and say there has to be a better way of doing things? I&#8217;ve always said that it is impossible for me to understand that every single government employee is incompetent. Every physician is greedy. Something&#8217;s wrong here.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: And that wrong was the architecture was wrong. And we knew that we could incorporate AI and make it better. So for me, that journey was one of wait, wait, wait. 10 years ago, begin to jump in. Six years ago, really jump in with our platform. And then, of course, in November 2022, things changed again.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. When did this idea of a data platform, what you now call the Mayo Clinic Platform (opens in new tab)‚Äîby the way, I refer to this as MCP, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Yeah, I know. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



LEE: [LAUGHS] ‚Ä¶ which I always smirk a little bit because, of course, for those of us in computer science research, the AI research, MCP has also become quite a hot topic because of the model context protocol version of this. But for Mayo&#8217;s MCP, when did that become a serious, defined initiative?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So around the end of ‚Äô18, 2018, beginning of 2019. At that point, we knew that we were going to do something differently. We came up with a strategic plan, as I took on the job, that we needed to cure more patients. There‚Äôs just not enough cures in the world. There&#8217;s too much suffering. And that we had all these chronic diseases that people have accepted are chronic, but really the only reason that disease is chronic is you haven&#8217;t cured it.&nbsp;



And physicians have been afraid to talk about cure because, of course, eventually everybody passes away.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: But I really pushed hard to say, no, it&#8217;s OK to talk about cure. It&#8217;s OK to aspire to cure. The second was connect‚Äîconnecting people with data to create new knowledge. And that&#8217;s where it became clear that data were not currently in a format that were particularly useful. By the way, you&#8217;ll hear me talk about data in the singular and the plural. I&#8217;m old school. I talk about data as plural, but I know that most younger people now use data singular. [LAUGHTER] And I apologize if I&#8217;ll go through that.&nbsp;



And then the third was transform. Let&#8217;s use Mayo&#8217;s resources to transform healthcare for ourselves and for others. And that&#8217;s the concept of, if we are able to use data in a different way, let&#8217;s create a different architecture. And that architecture had to be very closely linked to using artificial intelligence in order to create better outcomes for patients. So patients can live not only longer lives but healthier lives. And that&#8217;s the genesis of MCP, Mayo Clinic Platform, so I&#8217;ll timestamp that as end of 2018, beginning of 2019.&nbsp;



LEE: So I&#8217;m really wanting to delve in in this episode, in this conversation, you know, [into the] mindset of a health system or hospital CEO. And so you&#8217;re obviously thinking about, I guess, machine learning and predictive analytics and so on. What were the, kind of, like ‚Ä¶ in 2018, what were the outcomes that you were dreaming about from this? So if you had this thing, you know, what were the things that you were hoping to be able to show or, kind of, produce as results?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So first of all, I think all of us who work at Mayo Clinic, and this tends to be a bit sugary, but it&#8217;s true, strongly feel that we have a responsibility to leave the place better than when we started. And so the Mayo brothers, when they started, did two really important things. The first was that they created the first integrated healthcare system. And the second, they created the first unified record. And that record was, of course, paper at that point.&nbsp;



Part of that is to say, OK, what does it look like now versus how can we improve what we have if ‚Ä¶ it&#8217;d be blasphemy to say, let&#8217;s think of ourselves as the Mayo brothers, but let&#8217;s think of ourselves as reasonably smart people at Mayo Clinic, really lucky to be surrounded by very smart people with resources. What will we do? And so we said let&#8217;s not aim for the low-hanging fruit. Let&#8217;s aim to get at whatever you want to call it, the intractable knot, the hardest problem, and that is clinical care. Let&#8217;s improve clinical care. Yes, we can deal with burnout. Yes, we can deal with administrative burden. But let&#8217;s not focus on that. Let&#8217;s really create an architecture that allows us to tackle better clinical outcomes.&nbsp;



And by starting there, then everything flows from that. That it&#8217;s not really worth doing unless at the end of the day, people are experiencing better health.&nbsp;



LEE: And so I know a very good colleague and friend of mine, John Halamka (opens in new tab), you ended up hiring. I thought he was a very interesting choice because he is, of course, in terms of technology, quite deep and very expert, but he&#8217;s, I think, first and foremost, a doctor. And so I assume you must have had to decide what type of person you would bring in and what kinds of people you would bring in to try to create such a thing. What was your thinking around the choice of someone like John?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: It was one of the harder decisions. First of all, [I&#8217;m] a physician myself. We tend to want to maintain some control. And so now I am the CEO, [LAUGHTER] and I have to give this baby to somebody else. That&#8217;s very hard. Second is Mayo Clinic is really good because it is flat, and we run a lot by committee. But it also means that, therefore, you have to work really hard at change, and you cannot change by fiat. You have to change by convincing people.&nbsp;



So I just ‚Ä¶ I&#8217;ve always made the point that the right change agent is a servant leader because that&#8217;s how change becomes embedded. But it also means you&#8217;ve got to have that personality, the Mayo personality. And it became clear when we interviewed [that] there were some people that were really hardcore tech; others that were passionate about social issues. But John really fit that of being, as you said, deep in IT but also himself very aligned with the Mayo Clinic values. It&#8217;s as if he was a Mayo Clinic physician even though he wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp;



And that came together, and I felt, we felt, that as we were hiring, that we could do it. And then we did something interesting. We paired John with a ‚Ä¶ we created the role of a chief medical officer for the platform, which was a longstanding Mayo Clinic physician. And so we brought them together so we could get the past and the present and the future working together.&nbsp;



LEE: So I&#8217;m going to ask you about what has come out of this. But before that, let&#8217;s get back to this origin story. So now, all of that is being set up starting around 2018. But then, you know, in 2022, there is generative AI. Now you were already experimenting with transformers, starting with BERT out of Google there. So maybe that&#8217;s a couple of years earlier. But still, there has to come a point where things are feeling very disrupted.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Yeah, so, you know, it really wasn&#8217;t. It, to me, was a relief because it gave this ‚Ä¶ we were feeling pretty good about what we&#8217;re doing. We were feeling a little impatient, but, in true Mayo fashion, were willing to, sort of, do everything, take its time, take it to the right committees, get the right approvals, and get it done.&nbsp;



And so when generative AI came, for us, it&#8217;s like, I wouldn&#8217;t say we told you so, but it&#8217;s like, ah, there you go. Here&#8217;s another tool. This is what we&#8217;ve been talking about. Now we can do it even better. Now we can move even faster. Now we can do more for our patients. It truly never was disruptive. It truly immediately became enabling, which is strange, right, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ because something as disruptive as that instantly became enabling at Mayo Clinic. And I&#8217;ll take ‚Ä¶ as I think about it with you and take a moment to think and reflect on it, I think there were a couple of decisions we made earlier on that really helped us. We made the decision against the advice of any consulting firm to completely decentralize AI at Mayo Clinic six years ago. And we told our clinical department, you need to own this. You need to hire basic scientists in AI. We&#8217;ll help you by creating the infrastructure. We&#8217;ll help you by doing all the rest. We&#8217;ll have the compute. We&#8217;ll have the partners. You need to do this on your own. You need to treat this the same way as if a new radiological technique happened or a new surgical technique happened.&nbsp;



And so there was a lot of expertise already present in a very diffused way that then we were able to layer on generative AI onto that. And we found a very willingness to embrace it. In fact, I would argue initially a bit too willing because as you know, we haven&#8217;t quite figured out what&#8217;s legitimate use, what&#8217;s not use.&nbsp;We all learned together.



LEE: Right. Yep. Yep.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: But it was mostly energy, which is really interesting. It was mostly energy.



LEE: Wow. And, you know, it&#8217;s an amazing thing to hear because one common theme that we hear is that the initial reaction is oftentimes one of skepticism. In fact, I&#8217;ve been very open that even I initially had some skepticism. Was that not present in your mind or on your team&#8217;s mind at all at the beginning?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So you&#8217;re asking a physician if they are skeptical about something. [LAUGHTER] Yeah. I wonder what the answer to that is. Absolutely. The first hallucination, the first wrong reference. Can you imagine if you write the grant and the wrong reference comes. As you know, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ earlier on when some references were being made up. So massive amounts of skepticism. But the energy was such there that the people [who] were skeptical were also at the same time saying, ‚ÄúLet&#8217;s do a RAG [retrieval augmented generation] to clean up those references. Let&#8217;s create ‚Ä¶‚Äù We were experimenting with discharge summaries, but let&#8217;s use AI to police AI, and let&#8217;s see what&#8217;s going on. So there was more massive skepticism, but the energy was pushing that skepticism into a positive versus into a negative frame. Now, I say that summarizing in hindsight.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Day to day, much more complicated than that. But overall, if you just ‚Ä¶ and remember, I had been at the World Economic Forum many years ago and had said, healthcare needs to run towards AI.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: If healthcare was perfect, we would wait. Healthcare is not perfect by any means, therefore let&#8217;s run and embrace AI. And, sort of, that mentality was part of who we were because at the same time, we were also saying the other thing, that we need to be the ones to lead validation. We need to be the ones that set the rules. We need to be participating in the creation of CHAI [Coalition for Health AI] (opens in new tab). We need to be participating as the [National] Academy of Medicine (opens in new tab).&nbsp;



So people did feel that Mayo was being fairly responsible about it, but that urge to, the needs of the patient come first, was the driver that kept people wanting to say, ‚ÄúNot ready yet, but let&#8217;s make it ready.‚Äù And we now have 320 algorithms in the practice, and they run and we constantly are looking and seeing what else we can do to improve. But as you well know, things evolve and change. And we&#8217;re also looking and seeing which ones work and which ones don&#8217;t and which ones we have to work together on to make better.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, you know, of course Mayo has such a, you know, such a reputation and is so influential, but in the world of healthcare broadly, let&#8217;s just focus on the United States to start. How common is this experience? You know, so if you are at a meeting with fellow CEOs of hospitals and health systems, what is the attitude and what is the, kind of ‚Ä¶ how common is the approach to all of this?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: I think it&#8217;s more common now, but going back a few years, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that it was scary for people to know how it&#8217;s going to change things. Healthcare runs on very narrow margins. It&#8217;s very expensive. So your expenses and your revenue are both massive, and they are very close to each other. So anything that changes that balance is really scary.&nbsp;



Because it&#8217;s not like you have the opportunity to erode into a margin or get it right the second time. So I think that is what drove a lot of the initial hesitancy. Was, one, is lack of knowledge and, two, understanding that you didn&#8217;t have a lot of room to make a mistake.&nbsp;



LEE: On the economics of this, when you are embarking on what I suspect is a very expensive initiative like Mayo Clinic Platform, how on earth do you justify that early on?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So again, I&#8217;m trying hard to try and remember how things were versus how I think about them now. [LAUGHTER] It goes back to our history. Mayo has always invested in what it thinks is the right thing that is coming. And that&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve stayed where we are. So the investment really was having an open discussion: is this worth it for our patients? And once that discussion was over, then the board was saying, go, go, go.&nbsp;



Now we are lucky in that we have the size that we&#8217;re able to hire and absorb. We&#8217;re lucky in that the people [who] came before us have been financially astute, and one of our values is stewardship. And we&#8217;re lucky that we had a lot of patients at Mayo Clinic who were able to listen, be inspired by, and be willing to help support. And so that gave us the ability to build what we&#8217;re doing not only into the long-range plan but actually into the yearly plan. And so we built it into the yearly plan. We set up a center for digital health. We set up the platform. And then we set up the budgets to be able to do that. And the budgets came from assets we&#8217;ve had, assets that we would get as the year came by, and then from philanthropy.&nbsp;



We also had a really powerful calling card. And that&#8217;s one advantage I had, and that&#8217;s ‚Ä¶ and I&#8217;d been very open when I was speaking to other CEOs that would use it is that right at that very beginning, really, really in 2019, our cardiologists, both the researchers and the clinicians, had come together and had used electrocardiograms to create an AI algorithm.&nbsp;



The first one was for diagnosing from an electrocardiogram, which is very cheap, very easy to do, left ventricular dysfunction. That&#8217;s how hard the left part of the heart contracts. If it doesn&#8217;t do well, you get heart failure. And they were able to show that that algorithm was already making nurses better than the physician without the algorithm. And after that went on to show that you could do it from a single strip, really with an area under the curve for that single strip on a watch, that was as good as mammograms or pap smears. And so we already had that proof.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: That quickly then came into Mayo. We put it into it so that any patient now can benefit from it. And now there are, I think, 14 algorithms just from that same one.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So we had a proof of concept thanks to those really far-seeing cardiologists that enabled things to happen a little faster and also, as I talked to other CEOs, enabled me to say, ‚ÄúThis actually works. This is the path forward.‚Äù I have recently been vocal about also saying, we are at a point now where I believe that for some medical conditions, it is not right to not use AI to help treat them.&nbsp;



LEE: Wow, that&#8217;s so interesting. So I think I want to get into another topic here, which is when you think about the use of AI and data, what are some of the results that maybe are top of mind for you or you think are particularly important? And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;d like to see if we can think about this not only in terms of results in terms of patient outcomes but in your other activities, core activities, like research, in the education mission, and then even in the broader impacts on the healthcare system. But maybe we start with on patient outcomes.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Yeah, they&#8217;re all linked, right.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: They&#8217;re part of the same ecosystem. We think of ourselves as three shields‚Äî research, education, and the practice‚Äîand that one goes into the other. So, as I said, we have about 320 AI algorithms from the practice. Some run on every patient; some run on some patients. And we have good evidence for what they do. So some specific examples, and then I&#8217;ll get into the transformer part of this.&nbsp;



We have a program called CEDAR [Clinical Detection and Response (tool)], and like most other people, I like acronyms for things. [LAUGHTER] But what it is, in our hospitals with patient consent, we monitor vitals. We monitor in the patient room‚Äînot in the ICU [intensive care unit], in the patient room. We monitor all sorts of things. But there&#8217;s a camera in the room, and we have a team of intensivists‚Äînurses and physicians‚Äîwho do not have any patient responsibilities but are just monitoring the algorithms, and when the algorithms are predicting decompensation, they&#8217;re able to get into the room. And what we&#8217;ve shown, for example, with that algorithm, is we&#8217;ve shown we&#8217;ve decreased length of stay in the hospital, decreased transfers into the intensive care units, and interestingly, decreased mortality and morbidity, which is not easy to show. I talked about the electrocardiogram as a good example. Of course, everybody knows about the radiology things.&nbsp;



We&#8217;ve created ‚Ä¶ taken part of this and said, if we can do this in the hospital, why cannot we do it in patients&#8217; homes? So being very active in looking after patients that would come to the ED, emergency room, would normally be admitted, and we say, no, here are the things we can give you. Go home if you want to, and we will safely look after you at your home. And we recently have been, looking at the last two years of data, been able to show that we&#8217;re also successfully able to give intravenous chemotherapy in patients&#8217; homes because we can monitor; we can do all the things that we can do.&nbsp;



Now, with generative AI, that gave us many other opportunities. One biggest opportunity for me has always been digital pathology. When we see how pathology‚Äôs currently run with a glass slide, not much has changed ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ in many, many, many years, right.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: And so really we have made a massive push to digitize pathology not just for us but for others. But talking about ourselves, we started by saying, it has to be very cheap to digitize. So we worked and created a company with partners called Pramana (opens in new tab) that allows us to digitize slides relatively cheaply using AI algorithms that can take away the dirt, the fingerprint. And so we end up with 21 million of our slides digitized, and that gives you now a massive opportunity. Worked with another company called Aignostics (opens in new tab) to create a, what we call, Atlas (opens in new tab), which is an LLM that allows us to then build upon it.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: And we, a hundred and, I think, 120 years ago, invented frozen sections at Mayo Clinic. So what that is, is that while the patient&#8217;s still on the table, you can take a piece of tissue, look at it, and tell the surgeon the margins of what you&#8217;re trying to resect are clear or not. But as a result of that, because you have to hurry, you get no information as a surgeon about, is it an invasive cancer, is it noninvasive cancer, or other things. So we&#8217;ve just found a way to digitize our frozen section practice and will completely go across the enterprise with AI-enabled digitized frozen sections, which then enables us to then do it for anybody across the globe if we need to.&nbsp;



And then in the genomic space, we&#8217;re working to create a true exomic transformer that is short range. And we originally started doing it to see if we can test it against the fact that 40% of people with rheumatoid arthritis don&#8217;t respond to the first-line therapy, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ but you have to wait six months to find out. And we found that we can actually do that. But it has much greater uses, of course.&nbsp;



And then we&#8217;re working with you‚ÄîI don&#8217;t know how much you want to get into this, Peter, or [if] you want to talk about it yourself‚ÄîMAIRA-2, which is really exciting, about how taking a simple problem‚Äîcan you create a transformer that is able to detect if lines on the chest are in the right place, breathing tube is in the right place?‚Äîand then do it in a way that then can be used for many, many other things.&nbsp;



And then, Peter, because you asked about education and research, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: ‚Ä¶ imagine what this does now to the education system, right. And so we&#8217;ve got to train our physicians differently. We now have an AI curriculum for all our medical students. We offer masters and PhDs in AI. We think it&#8217;s essential for the people who want to be able to truly become experts, the same way I became an expert in my area of research.&nbsp;



And then from a research standpoint, when you think about all the registries that exist in people&#8217;s labs, all the spatial genomics, all the epigenomics, all the omics that exist. And if you are able to coalesce them into one big, what we call, an atlas, how that could really spur research at a scale that we haven&#8217;t thought of before. And so that is our aim at the moment.&nbsp;



From a research standpoint, we are, with Vijay Shah, who&#8217;s our dean of research, is to say, let&#8217;s make the effort of making sure all the data are available to be able to use and enable for us to take advantage of AI. And that is not easy because, of course, people have collected the data. They tend to want to embrace it.&nbsp;



LEE: Yep.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So there have to be the right incentives, the right privacy, and the right ways of doing it. And we think we&#8217;re on the way there, and we‚Äôre already seeing some advantages from doing it this way.&nbsp;



LEE: So we&#8217;re running short on time. And so I always like to end with one or two more provocative questions. And, you know, it&#8217;s tempting to ask you the provocative question of whether you think AI will ever replace human doctors, but I don&#8217;t want to go there with you. In fact, as I thought about our discussion, I was reflecting. We were at a conference together once, and I was on stage in a fireside chat. And then, you know, after the fireside chat, there were audience questions, and I don&#8217;t remember any of the questions from the audience except yours.&nbsp;



And just to remind you, you know, I think when I was on stage, we were talking about a lot of practical uses of AI to, let&#8217;s say, reduce administrative burdens and so on in healthcare. But you got up and you, I won&#8217;t say you scolded me, but you more or less said, is it the right idea to use AI to optimize today&#8217;s somewhat broken healthcare system, or should we be thinking more boldly about, you know, a more fundamental transformation?&nbsp;



And so what I thought I would try to close with here is to hear what was really behind that question. You know, what were you trying to get me to think about when you asked that question?&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: So first of all, darn your great memory [LAUGHTER]. Belated apologies ‚Ä¶ I probably should have &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: It was by far the best and most sophisticated and, I think, thought-provoking question of all of the ones that came out of the audience.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: What I was trying to get to is actually trying to clarify it in my own head and then in the head of others is that we do not need to have a linear path to get to where we want to get to. And we seemed to be on a linear path, which is, let&#8217;s try and reduce administrative burden. Let&#8217;s try and truly be a companion to a physician or other provider. Let&#8217;s make their problems better, make them feel better about providing healthcare. And then in the next step, we keep going until we get to, now we can call it agentic AI, whatever we want to talk about. And my view was, no, is that let&#8217;s start with that aim, the last aim, and do the others because the others will come automatically if you&#8217;re working on that harder problem.&nbsp;



Because one, to get to that harder problem, you&#8217;ll find all the other solutions. I was just trying to push that here&#8217;s this wonderful tool that&#8217;s been given to us. Let&#8217;s take advantage of it as quickly as we can. I think we had gotten a little too sensitized to need to say the right things. ‚ÄúCareful, be very careful‚Äù versus saying, ‚ÄúMassive opportunity. Do it right, and healthcare will be much better. Go for it.‚Äù&nbsp;



LEE: Well, I think I understand better now where the vision, insight, and frankly, courage to take on something as ambitious and transformational as the Mayo Clinic Platform and really all of your leadership in your tenure as the president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. I think I understand it much better now.&nbsp;



Gianrico, it&#8217;s just always such a privilege to interact with you and now to have a chance to work with you more closely. So thank you for everything that you do and thank you for joining us today.&nbsp;



FARRUGIA: Thank you for making it so easy, and thanks for giving us this opportunity to do good for the world.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]‚ÄØ



LEE: Gianrico leads what is arguably the crown jewel of the world&#8217;s healthcare systems, and so I feel it&#8217;s such a privilege to be able to talk and sometimes even brainstorm with him.&nbsp;



Our conversation, I think, exposed just how tech forward Gianrico is as he charts the strategies for healthcare delivery well into the future. And as I&#8217;ve interacted with many others, what I&#8217;ve learned is that this is a common trait among major health system CEOs. Roughly speaking, like we&#8217;ve seen in previous episodes where doctors and med students are polymath clinician-technologists, the same thing is true of health system CEOs and other leaders.&nbsp;



AI in the mind of a health system CEO today is not only a technology that can transform diagnosis and treatment, but it&#8217;s also something that can have a huge impact on the business of healthcare delivery, the connection of healthcare to medical research, and the journeys that patients go through as they seek better health.&nbsp;



These two conversations show that virtually all leaders in health and medicine are confronting head-on the opportunities, challenges, and the reality of AI, and they see a future that is potentially very different than what we have today.&nbsp;



[THEME MUSIC]&nbsp;



I&#8217;d like to thank Umair and Gianrico again for their time and insights. And to our listeners, thank you for joining us. We hope you&#8217;ll tune in to our final episode of the series. My coauthors, Carey and Zak, will be back to examine the takeaways from our most recent conversations.&nbsp;



Until next time.&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Self-adaptive reasoning for science
  Unlocking self-adaptive cognitive behavior that is more controllable and explainable than reasoning models in challenging scientific domains



Long-running LLM agents equipped with strong reasoning, planning, and execution skills have the potential to transform scientific discovery with high-impact advancements, such as developing new materials or pharmaceuticals. As these agents become more autonomous, ensuring effective human oversight and clear accountability becomes increasingly important, presenting challenges that must be addressed to unlock their full transformative power. Today‚Äôs approaches to long-term reasoning are established during the post-training phase, prior to end-user deployment and typically by the model provider. As a result, the expected actions of these agents are pre-baked by the model developer, offering little to no control from the end user.



At Microsoft, we are pioneering a vision for a continually steerable virtual scientist. In line with this vision, we created the ability to have a non-reasoning model develop thought patterns that allow for control and customizability by scientists. Our approach, a cognitive loop via in-situ optimization (CLIO), does not rely on reinforcement learning post-training to develop reasoning patterns yet still yields equivalent performance as demonstrated through our evaluation on Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam (HLE). Notably, we increased OpenAI GPT-4.1‚Äôs base model accuracy on text-only biology and medicine from 8.55% to 22.37%, an absolute increase of 13.82% (161.64% relative), surpassing o3 (high). This demonstrates that an optimization-based, self-adaptive AI system developed without further post-training can rival post-trained models in domains where adaptability, explainability, and control matter most.



Figure 1. Head-to-head comparison of OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.1 with CLIO, o3, and GPT-4.1 with no tools on HLE biology and medicine questions



In-situ optimization with internal self-reflection to enable self-adaptive reasoning



Model development has advanced from using reinforcement learning human feedback (RLHF) for answer alignment to external grading in reinforcement learning (RLVR). Recent approaches show promise in the utilization of intrinsic rewards for training reasoning models (RLIR). Traditionally, these reasoning processes are learned during the post-training process before any user interaction. While today‚Äôs reasoning models require additional data in the training phase and limit user control during the reasoning generation process, CLIO‚Äôs approach enables users to steer reasoning from scratch without additional data. Rather, CLIO generates its own necessary data by creating reflection loops at runtime. These reflection loops are utilized for a wide array of activities that CLIO self-defines, encompassing idea exploration, memory management, and behavior control. Most interesting is CLIO‚Äôs ability to leverage prior inferences to adjust future behaviors, handling uncertainties and raising flags for correction when necessary. Through this open architecture approach to reasoning, we alleviate the necessity for further model post-training to achieve desired reasoning behavior. Performing novel scientific discoveries often has no prior established patterns for reasoning, much less a large enough corpus of high-quality data to train on.&nbsp;



CLIO reasons by continuously reflecting on progress, generating hypotheses, and evaluating multiple discovery strategies. For the HLE test, CLIO was specifically steered to follow the scientific method as a guiding framework. Our research shows that equipping language models with self-adapting reasoning enhances their problem-solving ability. It provides a net benefit in quality for science questions, as well as providing exposure and control to the end user.



Figure 2. CLIO can raise key areas of uncertainty within its self-formulated reasoning process, balancing multiple different viewpoints using graph structures.



Control over uncertainty: Building trust in AI&nbsp;



Orchestrated reasoning systems like CLIO are valuable for scientific discovery, as they provide features beyond accuracy alone. Capabilities such as explaining the outcomes of internal reasoning are standard in the scientific field and are present in current reasoning model approaches. However, elements like displaying complete work, including final outcomes, internal thought processes, and uncertainty thresholds to support reproducibility or correction, as well as indicating uncertainty, are not yet universally implemented. Current models and systems do not have this same innate humility.&nbsp; Rather, we are left with models that produce confident results, whether correct or incorrect. When correct, it is valuable. When incorrect, it is dangerous to the scientific process. Hence, understanding a model or system‚Äôs uncertainty is a crucial aspect that we have developed natively into CLIO.



On the other end of the spectrum, orchestrated reasoning systems tend to oversaturate the user by raising too many flags. We enable prompt-free control knobs within CLIO to set thresholds for raising uncertainty flags. This allows CLIO to flag uncertainty for itself and the end user at the proper point in time. This also enables scientists to revisit CLIO‚Äôs reasoning path with critiques, edit beliefs during the reasoning process, and re-execute them from the desired point in time. Ultimately, this builds a foundational level of trust with scientists to use them in a scientifically defensible and rigorous way.&nbsp;



How does&nbsp;CLIO&nbsp;perform?&nbsp;



We evaluate CLIO against text-based biology and medicine questions from HLE. For this domain, we demonstrate a 61.98% relative increase or an 8.56% net increase in accuracy over OpenAI‚Äôs o3 and substantially outperform base completion models like OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.1, while enabling the requisite explainability and control. This technique applies to all models, showing similar increases in OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o model, which we observe performs poorly on HLE-level questions. On average, GPT-4.1 is not considered competent for HLE scale questions (GraphRAG. This extension of the cognition pattern provides a further 7.90% over a non-ensembled approach. &nbsp;



Figure 3. The impact of thinking effort on CLIO‚Äôs effectiveness.



Furthermore, CLIO‚Äôs design offers different knobs of control, for example, how much time to think and which technique to utilize for a given problem. In Figure 3, we demonstrate these knobs of control and their increase on GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o&#8217;s performance. In this case, we analyze performance for a subset of biomedical questions, those focused on immunology. CLIO increases GPT-4o&#8217;s base performance to be at par with the best reasoning models for immunology questions. We observe a 13.60% improvement over the base model, GPT-4o. This result shows CLIO to be model agnostic, similar to Microsoft AI Diagnostic Orchestrator&#8217;s (MAI-DxO) (opens in new tab)&#8216;s approach and corresponding performance boost.&nbsp;



Implications for science and trustworthy discovery



The future of scientific discovery demands more than reasoning over knowledge and raw computational power alone. Here, we demonstrate how CLIO not only increases model performance but establishes new layers of control for scientists. In our upcoming work, we will demonstrate how CLIO increases tool utility for highly valuable scientific questions in the drug discovery space which requires precise tools designed for the language of science. While our experiments focus on scientific discovery, we believe CLIO can apply in a domain-agnostic fashion. Experts tackling problems in domains such as financial analysis, engineering, and legal services could potentially benefit from AI systems with a transparent, steerable reasoning approach. Ultimately, we envision CLIO as an enduring control-layer in hybrid AI stacks that combine traditional completion and reasoning models, with external memory systems, and advanced tool calling. These continuous checks and balances that CLIO enables will continue to remain valuable even as components within the AI stacks evolve. This combination of intelligent and steerable scientific decision making and tool optimization is the basis of the recently announced Microsoft Discovery platform (opens in new tab).



At Microsoft, we‚Äôre committed to advancing AI research that earns the trust of scientists, empowering them to discover new frontiers of knowledge. Our work is a testament to what‚Äôs possible when we blend innovation with trustworthiness and a human-centered vision for the future of AI-assisted scientific discovery. We invite the research and scientific community to join us in shaping that future.

‚Ä¢ Project Ire autonomously identifies malware at scale
  Today, we are excited to introduce an autonomous AI agent that can analyze and classify software without assistance, a step forward in cybersecurity and malware detection. The prototype, Project Ire, automates what is considered the gold standard in malware classification: fully reverse engineering a software file without any clues about its origin or purpose. It uses decompilers and other tools, reviews their output, and determines whether the software is malicious or benign.



Project Ire&nbsp;emerged&nbsp;from a collaboration&nbsp;between&nbsp;Microsoft Research, Microsoft Defender Research, and Microsoft Discovery & Quantum, bringing together security&nbsp;expertise, operational knowledge, data from global malware telemetry, and AI research. It is built on the same collaborative and agentic foundation behind&nbsp;GraphRAG (opens in new tab)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Microsoft Discovery (opens in new tab).&nbsp;The system&nbsp;uses advanced language models and a suite of callable reverse engineering and binary analysis tools to drive investigation and adjudication.



As of this writing, Project Ire has achieved a precision (opens in new tab) of 0.98 and a recall (opens in new tab) of 0.83 using public datasets of Windows drivers. It was the first reverse engineer at Microsoft, human or machine, to author a conviction case‚Äîa detection strong enough to justify automatic blocking‚Äîfor a specific advanced persistent threat (APT) malware sample, which has since been identified and blocked by Microsoft Defender.&nbsp;



Malware classification at a global scale



Microsoft‚Äôs Defender platform scans more than one billion monthly (opens in new tab) active devices through the company‚Äôs Defender suite of products, which routinely require manual review of software by experts.



This kind of work is challenging. Analysts often face error and alert fatigue, and there‚Äôs no easy way to compare and standardize how different people review and classify threats over time. For both of these reasons, today&#8217;s overloaded experts are vulnerable to burnout, a well-documented issue in the field.



Unlike other AI applications in security, malware classification lacks a computable validator (opens in new tab). The AI must make judgment calls without definitive validation beyond expert review. Many behaviors found in software, like reverse engineering protections, don‚Äôt clearly indicate whether a sample is malicious or benign.&nbsp;



This ambiguity requires analysts to investigate each sample incrementally, building enough evidence to determine whether it‚Äôs malicious or benign despite opposition from adaptive, active adversaries. This&nbsp;has long made it difficult to automate and scale what is inherently a complex and expensive process.



Technical foundation



Project Ire attempts to address these challenges by acting as an autonomous system that uses specialized tools to reverse engineer software. The system‚Äôs architecture allows for reasoning at multiple levels, from low-level binary analysis to control flow reconstruction and high-level interpretation of code behavior.



Its tool-use API enables the system to update its understanding of a file using a wide range of reverse engineering tools, including Microsoft memory analysis sandboxes based on Project Freta (opens in new tab), custom and open-source tools, documentation search, and multiple decompilers.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Reaching a verdict&nbsp;



The evaluation process begins with a triage, where automated reverse engineering tools identify the file type, its structure, and potential areas of interest. From there, the system reconstructs the software‚Äôs control flow graph using frameworks such as angr (opens in new tab) and Ghidra (opens in new tab), building a graph that forms the backbone of Project Ire‚Äôs memory model and guides the rest of the analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Through iterative function analysis, the LLM calls specialized tools through an API to identify and summarize key functions. Each result feeds into a ‚Äúchain of evidence,‚Äù a detailed, auditable trail that shows how the system reached its conclusion. This traceable evidence log supports secondary review by security teams and helps refine the system in cases of misclassification.&nbsp;&nbsp;



To verify its findings, Project Ire can invoke a validator tool that cross-checks claims in the report against the chain of evidence. This tool draws on expert statements from malware reverse engineers on the Project Ire team. Drawing on this evidence and its internal model, the system creates a final report and classifies the sample as malicious or benign.

Preliminary testing shows promise&nbsp;



Two early evaluations tested Project Ire‚Äôs effectiveness as an autonomous malware classifier. In the first, we assessed Project Ire on a dataset of publicly accessible Windows drivers, some known to be malicious, others benign. Malicious samples came from the Living off the Land Drivers (opens in new tab) database, which includes a collection of Windows drivers used by attackers to bypass security controls, while known benign drivers were sourced from Windows Update.&nbsp;



This classifier performed well, correctly identifying 90% of all files and flagging only 2% of benign files as threats. It achieved a precision of 0.98 and a recall of 0.83. This low false-positive rate suggests clear potential for deployment in security operations, alongside expert reverse engineering reviews.&nbsp;



For each file it analyzes, Project Ire generates a report that includes an evidence section, summaries of all examined code functions, and other technical artifacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Figures 1 and 2 present reports for two successful malware classification cases generated during testing. The first involves a kernel-level rootkit, Trojan:Win64/Rootkit.EH!MTB (opens in new tab). The system identified several key features, including jump-hooking, process termination, and web-based command and control. It then correctly flagged the sample as malicious.






  
  Figure 1 Analysis
  


  
    The binary contains a function named &#8216;MonitorAndTerminateExplorerThread_16f64&#8217; that runs an infinite loop waiting on synchronization objects and terminates system threads upon certain conditions. It queries system or process information, iterates over processes comparing their names case-insensitively to &#8216;Explorer.exe&#8217;, and manipulates registry values related to &#8216;Explorer.exe&#8217;. This function appears to monitor and potentially terminate or manipulate the &#8216;Explorer.exe&#8217; process, a critical Windows shell process. Such behavior is suspicious and consistent with malware that aims to disrupt or control system processes.
    Another function, &#8216;HttpGetRequestAndResponse_174a4&#8217;, performs HTTP GET requests by parsing URLs, resolving hostnames, opening sockets, sending requests, and reading responses. This network communication capability could be leveraged for command and control or data exfiltration, common in malware.
    The binary also includes a function &#8216;PatchProcessEntryPointWithHook_12b5c&#8217; that patches the entry point of a process by writing a hook or trampoline that redirects execution to a specified address. This technique is commonly used for process injection or hooking, allowing malware to alter process behavior or inject malicious code.
    Other functions related to sending IOCTL requests to device drivers were identified, but their maliciousness could not be conclusively determined without additional context.
    Overall, the binary exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including process manipulation, network communication, and code injection techniques, suggesting it is likely malware designed to interfere with system processes and communicate with remote servers.
  


Figure 1. Project Ire report, sample with SHA256: 86047bb1969d1db455493955fd450d18c62a3f36294d0a6c3732c88dfbcc4f62 (opens in new tab)



The second sample, HackTool:Win64/KillAV!MTB (opens in new tab), was designed to disable antivirus software. Project Ire correctly identified the code that locates and disables antivirus programs, providing evidence that the file was malicious.&nbsp;&nbsp;



In one section of the code, however, the system misidentified a function as anti-debugging behavior. To maintain accuracy, the system used the validator tool to flag the claim as unsupported. The issue was later resolved by updating decompiler rules, but this example illustrates how Project Ire navigates uncertainty during analysis. Figure 2 shows the corresponding report.&nbsp;






  
  Figure 2 Analysis
  


  
    The binary contains several functions indicative of malicious intent. The function register_and_log_known_processes_140001000 logs and registers process names associated with antivirus and security software, such as &#8216;avp.exe&#8217;, &#8216;avpui.exe&#8217;, and &#8216;360Tray.exe&#8217;. It calls another function, TerminateProcessesByNameSubstring_1400010f4, which enumerates system processes and terminates those whose names contain specified substrings. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to disable or evade security software by killing their processes.
    Another function, check_and_handle_special_state_14000502c, performs checks on a global variable and triggers software interrupts if certain conditions are not met. While the exact purpose of these interrupts (int 0x29 and int 0x3) is unclear, they could represent an anti-debug or anti-analysis mechanism to detect or interfere with debugging or tampering attempts. However, this assumption could not be fully validated against expert statements.
    Other functions include initialization routines and simple logging wrappers, but the core malicious behavior centers on process termination targeting security software. This indicates the binary is designed to compromise system security by disabling protective processes, a hallmark of malware such as trojans or rootkits.

Real-world evaluation with Microsoft Defender&nbsp;



The more demanding test involved nearly 4,000 ‚Äúhard-target‚Äù files not classified by automated systems and slated for manual review by expert reverse engineers.



In this real-world scenario, Project Ire operated fully autonomously on files created after the language models‚Äô training cutoff, files that no other automated tools at Microsoft could classify at the time.



The system achieved a high precision score of 0.89, meaning nearly 9 out of 10 files flagged malicious were correctly identified as malicious. Recall was 0.26, indicating that under these challenging conditions, the system detected roughly a quarter of all actual malware.



The system correctly identified many of the malicious files, with few false alarms, just a 4% false positive rate. While overall performance was moderate, this combination of accuracy and a low error rate suggests real potential for future deployment.



Looking ahead&nbsp;



Based on these early successes, the Project Ire prototype will be leveraged inside Microsoft‚Äôs Defender organization as Binary Analyzer for threat detection and software classification.



Our goal is to scale the system‚Äôs speed and accuracy so that it can correctly classify files from any source, even on first encounter. Ultimately, our vision is to detect novel malware directly in memory, at scale.

‚Ä¢ VeriTrail: Detecting hallucination and tracing provenance in multi-step AI workflows
  Watch VeriTrail Explainer




Many applications of language models (LMs) involve generating content based on source material, such as answering questions, summarizing information, and drafting documents. A critical challenge for these applications is that LMs may produce content that is not supported by the source text ‚Äì a phenomenon known as ‚Äúclosed-domain hallucination.‚Äù1



Existing methods for detecting closed-domain hallucination typically compare a given LM output to the source text, implicitly assuming that there is only a single output to evaluate. However, applications of LMs increasingly involve processes with multiple generative steps: LMs generate intermediate outputs that serve as inputs to subsequent steps and culminate in a final output. Many agentic workflows follow this paradigm (e.g., each agent is responsible for a specific document or sub-task, and their outputs are synthesized into a final response).‚ÄØ&nbsp;



In our paper ‚ÄúVeriTrail: Closed-Domain Hallucination Detection with Traceability,‚Äù we argue that, given the complexity of processes with multiple generative steps, detecting hallucination in the final output is necessary but not sufficient. We also need traceability, which has two components:&nbsp;




Provenance: if the final output is supported by the source text, we should be able to trace its path through the intermediate outputs to the source.&nbsp;



Error Localization: if the final output is not supported by the source text, we should be able to trace where the error was likely introduced.




Our paper presents VeriTrail, the first closed-domain hallucination detection method designed to provide traceability for processes with any number of generative steps. We also demonstrate that VeriTrail outperforms baseline methods commonly used for hallucination detection. In this blog post, we provide an overview of VeriTrail‚Äôs design and performance.2



VeriTrail‚Äôs hallucination detection process



A key idea leveraged by VeriTrail is that a wide range of generative processes can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node in the DAG represents a piece of text (i.e., source material, an intermediate output, or the final output) and each edge from node A to node B indicates that A was used as an input to produce B. Each node is assigned a unique ID, as well as a stage reflecting its position in the generative process.‚ÄØ&nbsp;



An example of a process with multiple generative steps is GraphRAG. A DAG representing a GraphRAG run is illustrated in Figure 1, where the boxes and arrows correspond to nodes and edges, respectively.3



Figure 1: GraphRAG splits the source text into chunks (Stage 1). For each chunk, an LM extracts entities and relationships (the latter are denoted by ‚Äú‚≠§ ‚Äú), along with short descriptions (Stage 2). If an entity or a relationship was extracted from multiple chunks, an LM summarizes the descriptions (Stage 3). A knowledge graph is constructed from the final set of entities and relationships, and a community detection algorithm, such as Leiden clustering, groups entities into communities. For each community, an LM generates a ‚Äúcommunity report‚Äù that summarizes the entities and relationships (Stage 4). To answer a user‚Äôs question, an LM generates ‚Äúmap-level answers‚Äù based on groups of community reports (Stage 5), then synthesizes them into a final answer (Stage 6).



VeriTrail takes as input a DAG representing a completed generative process and aims to determine whether the final output is fully supported by the source text. It begins by extracting claims (i.e., self-contained, verifiable statements) from the final output using Claimify. VeriTrail verifies claims in the reverse order of the generative process: it starts from the final output and moves toward the source text. Each claim is verified separately. Below, we include two case studies that illustrate how VeriTrail works, using the DAG from Figure 1.‚ÄØ



Case study 1: A ‚ÄúFully Supported‚Äù claim



Figure 2: Left: GraphRAG as a DAG. Right: VeriTrail‚Äôs hallucination detection process for a ‚ÄúFully Supported‚Äù claim.



Figure 2 shows an example of a claim that VeriTrail determined was not hallucinated:‚ÄØ




In Iteration 1, VeriTrail identified the nodes that were used as inputs for the final answer: Nodes 15 and 16. Each identified node was split into sentences, and each sentence was programmatically assigned a unique ID.

An LM then performed Evidence Selection, selecting all sentence IDs that strongly implied the truth or falsehood of the claim. The LM also generated a summary of the selected sentences (not shown in Figure 2). In this example, a sentence was selected from Node 15.



Next, an LM performed Verdict Generation. If no sentences had been selected in the Evidence Selection step, the claim would have been assigned a ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdict. Instead, an LM was prompted to classify the claim as ‚ÄúFully Supported,‚Äù ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported,‚Äù or ‚ÄúInconclusive‚Äù based on the evidence. In this case, the verdict was ‚ÄúFully Supported.‚Äù





Since the verdict in Iteration 1 was ‚ÄúFully Supported,‚Äù VeriTrail proceeded to Iteration 2. It considered the nodes from which at least one sentence was selected in the latest Evidence Selection step (Node 15) and identified their input nodes (Nodes 12 and 13). VeriTrail repeated Evidence Selection and Verdict Generation for the identified nodes. Once again, the verdict was ‚ÄúFully Supported.‚Äù This process ‚Äì identifying candidate nodes, performing Evidence Selection and Verdict Generation ‚Äì was repeated in Iteration 3, where the verdict was still ‚ÄúFully Supported,‚Äù and likewise in Iteration 4.‚ÄØ



In Iteration 4, a single source text chunk was verified. Since the source text, by definition, does not have any inputs, verification terminated and the verdict was deemed final.




Case study 2: A ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù claim



Figure 3: Left: GraphRAG as a DAG. Right: VeriTrail‚Äôs hallucination detection‚ÄØprocess for a ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù claim, where the maximum number of consecutive ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdicts was set to 2. 



Figure 3 provides an example of a claim where VeriTrail identified hallucination:




In Iteration 1, VeriTrail identified the nodes used as inputs for the final answer: Nodes 15 and 16. After Evidence Selection and Verdict Generation, the verdict was ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported.‚Äù Users can configure the maximum number of consecutive ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdicts permitted. If the maximum had been set to 1, verification would have terminated here, and the verdict would have been deemed final. Let‚Äôs assume the maximum was set to 2, meaning that VeriTrail had to perform at least one more iteration.



Even though evidence was selected only from Node 15 in Iteration 1, VeriTrail checked the input nodes for both Node 15 and Node 16 (i.e., Nodes 12, 13, and 14) in Iteration 2. Recall that in Case Study 1 where the verdict was ‚ÄúFully Supported,‚Äù VeriTrail only checked the input nodes for Node 15. Why was the ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù claim handled differently? If the Evidence Selection step overlooked relevant evidence, the ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdict might be incorrect. In this case, continuing verification based solely on the selected evidence (i.e., Node 15) would propagate the mistake, defeating the purpose of repeated verification.



In Iteration 2, Evidence Selection and Verdict Generation were repeated for Nodes 12, 13, and 14. Once again, the verdict was ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported.‚Äù Since this was the second consecutive ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdict, verification terminated and the verdict was deemed final.

Providing traceability



In addition to assigning a final ‚ÄúFully Supported,‚Äù ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported,‚Äù or ‚ÄúInconclusive‚Äù verdict to each claim, VeriTrail returns (a) all Verdict Generation results and (b) an evidence trail composed of all Evidence Selection results: the selected sentences, their corresponding node IDs, and the generated summaries. Collectively, these outputs provide traceability:&nbsp;




Provenance: For ‚ÄúFully Supported‚Äù and ‚ÄúInconclusive‚Äù claims, the evidence trail traces a path from the source material to the final output, helping users understand how the output may have been derived. For example, in Case Study 1, the evidence trail consists of Sentence 8 from Node 15, Sentence 11 from Node 13, Sentence 26 from Node 4, and Sentence 79 from Node 1.



Error Localization: For ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù claims, VeriTrail uses the Verdict Generation results to identify the stage(s) of the process where the unsupported content was likely introduced. For instance, in Case Study 2, where none of the verified intermediate outputs supported the claim, VeriTrail would indicate that the hallucination occurred in the final answer (Stage 6). Error stage identification helps users address hallucinations and understand where in the process they are most likely to occur.&nbsp;




The evidence trail also helps users verify the verdict: instead of reading through all nodes ‚Äì which may be infeasible for processes that generate large amounts of text ‚Äì users can simply review the evidence sentences and summaries.‚ÄØ



Key design features



VeriTrail‚Äôs design prioritizes reliability, efficiency, scalability, and user agency. Notable features include:‚ÄØ




During Evidence Selection (introduced in Case Study 1), the sentence IDs returned by the LM are checked against the programmatically assigned IDs. If a returned ID does not match an assigned ID, it is discarded; otherwise, it is mapped to its corresponding sentence. This approach guarantees that the sentences included in the evidence trail are not hallucinated.



After a claim is assigned an interim ‚ÄúFully Supported‚Äù or ‚ÄúInconclusive‚Äù verdict (as in Case Study 1), VeriTrail verifies the input nodes of only the nodes from which evidence was previously selected ‚Äì not all possible input nodes. By progressively narrowing the search space, VeriTrail limits the number of nodes the LM must evaluate. In particular, since VeriTrail starts from the final output and moves toward the source text, it tends to verify a smaller proportion of nodes as it approaches the source text. Nodes closer to the source text tend to be larger (e.g., a book chapter should be larger than its summary), so verifying fewer of them helps reduce computational cost.



VeriTrail is designed to handle input graphs with any number of nodes, regardless of whether they fit in a single prompt. Users can specify an input size limit per prompt. For Evidence Selection, inputs that exceed the limit are split across multiple prompts. If the resulting evidence exceeds the input size limit for Verdict Generation, VeriTrail reruns Evidence Selection to compress the evidence further. Users can configure the maximum number of Evidence Selection reruns.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ



The configurable maximum number of consecutive ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdicts (introduced in Case Study 2) allows the user to find their desired balance between computational cost and how conservative VeriTrail is in flagging hallucinations. A lower maximum reduces cost by limiting the number of checks. A higher maximum increases confidence that a flagged claim is truly hallucinated since it requires repeated confirmation of the ‚ÄúNot Fully Supported‚Äù verdict.‚ÄØ




Evaluating VeriTrail‚Äôs performance



We tested VeriTrail on two datasets covering distinct generative processes (hierarchical summarization4 and GraphRAG), tasks (summarization and question-answering), and types of source material (fiction novels and news articles). For the source material, we focused on long documents and large collections of documents (i.e., >100K tokens), where hallucination detection is especially challenging and processes with multiple generative steps are typically most valuable. The resulting DAGs were much more complex than the examples provided above (e.g., in one of the datasets, the average number of nodes was 114,368).



We compared VeriTrail to three types of baseline methods commonly used for closed-domain hallucination detection: Natural Language Inference models (AlignScore and INFUSE); Retrieval-Augmented Generation; and long-context models (Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4.1 mini). Across both datasets and all language models tested, VeriTrail outperformed the baseline methods in detecting hallucination.5



Most importantly, VeriTrail traces claims through intermediate outputs ‚Äì unlike the baseline methods, which directly compare the final output to the source material. As a result, it can identify where hallucinated content was likely introduced and how faithful content may have been derived from the source. By providing traceability, VeriTrail brings transparency to generative processes, helping users understand, verify, debug, and, ultimately, trust their outputs.‚ÄØ&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ The DIVA logistics agent, powered by Amazon Bedrock
  DTDC is India‚Äôs leading integrated express logistics provider, operating the largest network of customer access points in the country. DTDC‚Äôs technology-driven logistics solutions cater to a wide range of customers across diverse industry verticals, making them a trusted partner in delivering excellence. 
DTDC Express Limited receives over 400,000 customer queries each month, ranging from tracking requests to serviceability checks and shipping rates. With such a high volume of shipments, their existing logistics agent, DIVA, was operated on a rigid, guided workflow, forcing users to follow a structured path rather than engaging in natural, dynamic conversations. The lack of flexibility resulted in increased burden on customer support teams, longer resolution times, and poor customer experience. 
DTDC was looking for a more flexible, intelligent assistant‚Äîone that could understand context, manage complex queries, and improve efficiency while reducing reliance on human agents. To achieve a better customer experience, DTDC decided to enhance DIVA with generative AI using Amazon Bedrock. 
ShellKode is an AWS Partner, born-in-the-cloud company specializing in modernization, security, data, generative AI, and machine learning (ML). With a mission to drive transformative growth, ShellKode empowers businesses through state-of-the-art technology solutions that address complex challenges and unlock new opportunities. Using deep industry expertise, they deliver tailored strategies that foster innovation, efficiency, and long-term success in an evolving digital landscape. 
In this post, we discuss how DTDC and ShellKode used Amazon Bedrock to build DIVA 2.0, a generative AI-powered logistics agent. 
Solution overview 
To address the limitations of the existing logistics agent, ShellKode built an advanced agentic assistant using Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, and an API integration layer. 
When customers interact with DIVA 2.0, they experience a seamless, conversational interface that understands and responds to their queries naturally. Whether tracking a package, checking shipping rates, or inquiring about service availability, users can ask questions in their own words without following a rigid script. DIVA 2.0‚Äôs enhanced AI capabilities allow it to understand context, manage complex requests, and provide accurate, personalized responses, significantly improving the overall customer experience and reducing the need for human intervention. The following high-level architecture diagram illustrates the application flow and the solution architecture with AWS services. 
 
The DTDC logistics agent is designed using a modular and scalable architecture to provide seamless integration and high performance. This streamlined workflow demonstrates how a generative AI-powered serverless logistics agent using AWS App Runner, Amazon Bedrock Agents, AWS Lambda, and a vector-based knowledge base handles user queries ranging from tracking requests to serviceability checks and shipping rates intelligently and efficiently. 
The logistics agent is hosted as a static website using Amazon CloudFront and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). The logistics agent is integrated with the DTDC website, which provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for end-user interactions (see the following screenshot). 
 
An end-user accesses the logistics agent through the DTDC website and submits queries like tracking shipments, checking service availability, calculating shipping rates, FAQs, and so on using natural language.The user requests are processed by App Runner, which helps run the web application (including API services, backend web services, and websites) on AWS. App Runner is hosted with multiple API services, such as the Amazon Bedrock Agents API and Dashboard API. App Runner initiates the Amazon Bedrock Agents API based on the user requests. 
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of industry leading foundation models (FMs) along with a broad set of capabilities to build generative AI applications, simplifying development with security, privacy, and responsible AI. With Amazon Bedrock, your content is not used to improve the base models and is not shared with any model providers. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards to help safely build generative AI applications at scale. To learn more, see Build safe and responsible generative AI applications with guardrails. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps administrators securely control who can be authenticated and authorized to use Amazon Bedrock resources. 
The Amazon Bedrock agents are configured in Amazon Bedrock. An Amazon Bedrock agent receives the request and interprets the user‚Äôs intent using its natural language understanding capabilities. Based on the interpreted intent, the agent triggers an appropriate Lambda function, such as: 
 
 Tracking consignments 
 Pricing information 
 Location serviceability check 
 Support ticket creation 
 
The triggered Lambda function calls the following client APIs, retrieves the relevant data, and returns the response to the agent: 
 
 Tracking System API ‚Äì Retrieves real-time status and provides updates on consignment shipment tracking 
 Delivery Franchise Location API ‚Äì Checks the service availability to deliver the parcels between the locations 
 Pricing System API ‚Äì Calculates the shipping rates based on shipment details provided by the user 
 Customer Care API ‚Äì Creates a support ticket for the end-users 
 
The agent passes the response to the large language model (LLM), in this case Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.0 on Amazon Bedrock, which understands the context of the retrieved data, processes it, and generates a meaningful response for the user. 
The knowledge base contains web-scraped content from the DTDC website, internal support documentation, FAQs, and operational data, enabling real-time updates and accurate responses. The knowledge base contents are stored as vector embeddings in Amazon OpenSearch Service, providing quick and relevant responses. For general queries, the logistics agent fetches information from Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, providing accuracy and relevance. Using semantic similarity search, relevant chunks of information are retrieved from the knowledge base based on the user‚Äôs query, which Amazon Bedrock then uses to generate a context-aware response. If no relevant data is found in the knowledge base, a fallback response (preconfigured in the Amazon Bedrock prompt) is returned, indicating that the system couldn‚Äôt assist with the request. 
The logistics agent queries and associated responses are stored in Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for PostgreSQL for enhanced scalability and relational data handling. App Runners initiates the Dashboard API call to update the queries and associated responses in Amazon RDS. We discuss this in more detail the following section. 
Throughout the process, Amazon CloudWatch Logs captures key events such as intent recognition, Lambda invocations, API responses, and fallback triggers for auditing and system monitoring. AWS CloudTrail records and monitors activity in the AWS account, including actions taken by users, roles, or AWS services. It logs these events, which can be used for operational auditing, governance, and compliance. 
Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that continuously monitors, analyzes, and processes AWS data sources and logs in your AWS environment. GuardDuty uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, file hashes, and ML models to identify suspicious and potentially malicious activity in the AWS environment. 
Logistics agent dashboard 
The following high-level architecture diagram illustrates the logistics agent dashboard, which captures the end-user interactions and its associated responses. 
 
The logistics agent dashboard is hosted as a static website using CloudFront and Amazon S3. Dashboard access is allowed only for the DTDC admin team. 
The dashboard is populated through API calls using Amazon API Gateway with Lambda as a backend, which retrieves the dashboard data from Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
The dashboard provides real-time insights into the logistics agent performance, including accuracy, unresolved queries, query categories, session statistics, and user interaction data (see the following screenshot). It provides actionable insights with features such as heat maps, pie charts, and session logs. Real-time data is logged and analyzed on the dashboard, enabling continuous improvement and quick issue resolution. 
 
Solution challenges and benefits 
When implementing DIVA 2.0, DTDC and ShellKode faced several significant challenges. Integrating real-time data from multiple legacy systems was crucial for providing accurate, up-to-date information on tracking, rates, and serviceability. This was likely addressed through the robust API integration capabilities of Amazon Bedrock Agents. Another major hurdle was training the AI to understand complex logistics terminology and multi-step queries, which was overcome by using Amazon Bedrock LLMs and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases, fine-tuned with industry-specific data. The team also had to navigate the delicate process of transitioning from the old rigid DIVA system while maintaining service continuity and preserving historical data, potentially employing a phased approach with parallel systems. Finally, scaling the solution to handle over 400,000 monthly queries while maintaining performance was a significant challenge, addressed by using the cloud infrastructure of Amazon Bedrock Agents for optimal scalability and performance. These challenges underscore the complexity of upgrading to an AI-powered system in a high-volume, data-intensive industry like logistics, and highlight how AWS solutions provided the necessary tools to overcome these obstacles. DTDC realized the following benefits from powering the logistics agent with generative AI using Amazon Bedrock: 
 
 Enhanced conversations and real-time data access with customer support agents ‚Äì Powered by Amazon Bedrock Agents, the solution improves natural language understanding, enabling more fluid and engaging conversations. With multi-step reasoning, it can handle a broader range of queries with greater accuracy. Additionally, by integrating seamlessly with DTDC‚Äôs API layer, the logistics agent provides real-time access to vital information, such as tracking shipments, service availability, and calculating shipping rates. The combination of advanced conversational capabilities and real-time data provides fast, accurate, and contextually relevant responses. 
 Intelligent data processing and accurate FAQ responses ‚Äì For complex queries, the logistics agent uses LLM technology to process raw data and deliver structured, tailored responses. This makes sure users get clear, actionable insights. For frequently asked questions, the logistics agent uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to deliver precise answers without requiring human support, reducing wait times and enhancing the overall user experience. 
 Reduced live agent dependency and continuous improvement ‚Äì Although the logistics agent hasn‚Äôt eliminated the need for customer support, the number of queries handled by the customer support team has reduced by 51.4%. The system provides valuable insights into key performance metrics like peak query times, unresolved issues, and overall engagement through integrated real-time analytics, helping refine and improve the assistant‚Äôs capabilities over time. 
 
Results 
The generative AI-powered logistics agent has reduced the burden on customer support teams and shortened resolution times, resulting in better customer experience: 
 
 Powered by Amazon Bedrock, DIVA 2.0 understands queries in natural language and supports dynamic conversations with a response accuracy of 93% 
 Based on the last 3 months of dashboard metrics data, they observed the following: 
   
   71% of the inquiries were related to consignments (256,048), whereas 29.5% were general inquiries (107,132) 
   51.4% of consignment inquiries (131,530) didn‚Äôt result in a support ticket, whereas 48.6% (124,518) led to new support ticket creation 
   Of the inquiries that resulted in tickets, 40% started with the customer support center before moving to the AI assistant, whereas 60% began with the assistant before involving the customer support center 
    
 
DIVA 2.0 has reduced the number of queries handled by the customer support team by 51.4%. DTDC‚Äôs support team can now focus on more critical issues, improving overall efficiency.
