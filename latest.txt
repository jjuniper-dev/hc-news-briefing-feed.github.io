• A Chinese firm has just launched a constantly changing set of AI benchmarks
  <p>When testing an AI model, it’s hard to tell if it is reasoning or just regurgitating answers from its training data. Xbench, a new benchmark developed by the Chinese venture capital firm HSG, or HongShan Capital Group, might help to sidestep that issue. That’s thanks to the way it evaluates models not only on the ability to pass arbitrary tests, like most other benchmarks, but also on the ability to execute real-world tasks, which is more unusual. It will be updated on a regular basis to try to keep it evergreen.&nbsp;</p>    <p>This week the company is making part of its question set open-source and letting anyone use for free. The team has also released a leaderboard comparing how mainstream AI models stack up when tested on Xbench. (ChatGPT o3 ranked first across all categories, though ByteDance’s Doubao, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok all still did pretty well, as did Claude Sonnet.)&nbsp;</p>    <p>Development of the benchmark at HongShan began in 2022, following ChatGPT’s breakout success, as an internal tool for assessing which models are worth investing in. Since then, led by partner Gong Yuan, the team has steadily expanded the system, bringing in outside researchers and professionals to help refine it. As the project grew more sophisticated, they decided to release it to the public.</p>    <p>Xbench approached the problem with two different systems. One is similar to traditional benchmarking: an academic test that gauges a model’s aptitude on various subjects. The other is more like a technical interview round for a job, assessing how much real-world economic value a model might deliver.</p>    <p>Xbench’s methods for assessing raw intelligence currently include two components: Xbench-ScienceQA and Xbench-DeepResearch. ScienceQA isn’t a radical departure from existing postgraduate-level STEM benchmarks like <a href="https://github.com/idavidrein/gpqa">GPQA</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14739">SuperGPQA</a>. It includes questions spanning fields from biochemistry to orbital mechanics, drafted by graduate students and double-checked by professors. Scoring rewards not only the right answer but also the reasoning chain that leads to it.</p>    <p>DeepResearch, by contrast, focuses on a model’s ability to navigate the Chinese-language web. Ten subject-matter experts created 100 questions in music, history, finance, and literature—questions that can’t just be googled but require significant research to answer. Scoring favors breadth of sources, factual consistency, and a model’s willingness to admit when there isn’t enough data. A question in the publicized collection is “How many Chinese cities in the three northwestern provinces border a foreign country?” (It’s 12, and only 33% of models tested got it right, if you are wondering.)</p>    <p>On the company’s website, the researchers said they want to add more dimensions to the test—for example, aspects like how creative a model is in its problem solving, how collaborative it is when working with other models, and how reliable it is.</p>    <p>The team has committed to updating the test questions once a quarter and to maintain a half-public, half-private data set.</p>    <p>To assess models’ real-world readiness, the team worked with experts to develop tasks modeled on actual workflows, initially in recruitment and marketing. For example, one task asks a model to source five qualified battery engineer candidates and justify each pick. Another asks it to match advertisers with appropriate short-video creators from a pool of over 800 influencers.</p>    <p>The website also teases upcoming categories, including finance, legal, accounting, and design. The question sets for these categories have not yet been open-sourced.</p>    <p>ChatGPT-o3 again ranks first in both of the current professional categories. For recruiting, Perplexity Search and Claude 3.5 Sonnet take second and third place, respectively. For marketing, Claude, Grok, and Gemini all perform well.</p>    <p>“It is really difficult for benchmarks to include things that are so hard to quantify,” says Zihan Zheng, the lead researcher on a new benchmark called LiveCodeBench Pro and a student at NYU. “But Xbench represents a promising start.”</p> { Jun 23, 2025 }
• Scaling integrated digital health
  <p>Around the world, countries are facing the challenges of aging populations, growing rates of chronic disease, and workforce shortages, leading to a growing burden on health care systems. From diagnosis to treatment, AI and other digital solutions can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of health care, easing the burden on straining systems. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), spending an additional $0.24 per patient per year on digital health interventions could save more than two million lives from non-communicable diseases over the next decade.</p>    <p>To work most effectively, digital solutions need to be scaled and embedded in an ecosystem that ensures a high degree of interoperability, data security, and governance. If not, the proliferation of point solutions— where specialized software or tools focus on just one specific area or function—could lead to silos and digital canyons, complicating rather than easing the workloads of health care professionals, and potentially impacting patient treatment. Importantly, technologies that enhance workforce productivity should keep humans in the loop, aiming to augment their capabilities, rather than replace them.&nbsp;</p>    <p>Through a survey of 300 health care executives and a program of interviews with industry experts, startup leaders, and academic researchers, this report explores the best practices for success when implementing integrated digital solutions into health care, and how these can support decision-makers in a range of settings, including laboratories and hospitals.&nbsp;</p>    <figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img alt="" class="wp-image-1119012" height="2000" src="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MITTR-Roche25_V17_CoverPage.png?w=1555" style="width: 636px; height: auto;" width="1555" /></figure>    <div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-left is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-fc4fd283 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"> <div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-auto is-style-fill is-style-fill--1"><a class="wp-block-button__link has-mittr-white-color has-text-color has-background has-custom-font-size wp-element-button" href="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MITTR-Roche-report_final_062225.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" style="border-radius: 4px; background-color: #2316a1; font-size: 16px;" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD THE REPORT</a></div> </div>    <p><br />Key findings include:&nbsp;</p>    <p><br /><strong>Health care is primed for digital adoption. </strong>The global pandemic underscored the benefits of value-based care&nbsp;and accelerated the adoption of digital and AI-powered technologies in health care. Overwhelmingly, 96% of the survey respondents say they are “ready and resourced” to use digital health, while one in four say they are “very ready.” However, 91% of executives agree interoperability is a challenge, with a majority (59%) saying it will be “tough” to solve. Two in five leaders say balancing security with usability is the biggest challenge for digital health. With the adoption of cloud solutions, organizations can enjoy the benefits of modernized IT infrastructure: 36% of the survey respondents believe scalability is the main benefit, followed by improved security (28%).&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Digital health care can help health care institutions transform patient outcomes—if built on the right foundations. </strong>Solutions like AI-powered diagnostics, telemedicine, and remote monitoring can offer measurable impact across the patient journey, from improving early disease detection to reducing hospital readmission rates. However, these technologies can only support fully connected health care when scaled up and embedded in ecosystems with robust data governance, interoperability, and security. </p>    <p><strong>Health care data has immense potential—but fragmentation and poor interoperability hinder impact. </strong>Health care systems generate vast quantities of data, yet much of it remains siloed or unusable due to inconsistent formats and incompatible IT systems, limiting scalability.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Digital tools must augment, not&nbsp;overload, the workforce. </strong>With global health care workforce shortages worsening, digital solutions like clinical decision support tools, patient prediction, and remote monitoring can be seen as essential aids rather than threats to the workforce. Successful deployment depends on usability, clinician engagement, and training.&nbsp;</p>    <p><strong>Regulatory evolution, open data policies, and economic sustainability are key to scaling digital health. </strong>Even the best digital tools struggle to scale without reimbursement frameworks, regulatory support, and viable business models. Open data ecosystems are needed to unleash the clinical and economic value of innovation. Regulatory and reimbursement innovation is also critical to transitioning from pilot projects to high-impact, system-wide adoption.</p>    <p><a href="https://wp.technologyreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MITTR-Roche-report_final_062225.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Download the full report</a>.</p>    <p><em>This content was produced by Insights, the custom content arm of MIT Technology Review.

• Inside a Dark Adtech Empire Fed by Fake CAPTCHAs
  <p>Late last year, security researchers made a startling discovery: Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns were bypassing moderation on social media platforms by leveraging the same malicious advertising technology that powers a sprawling ecosystem of online hucksters and website hackers. A new report on the fallout from that investigation finds this dark ad tech industry is far more resilient and incestuous than previously known.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71492" style="width: 760px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-71492" height="422" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maladtech.png" width="750" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71492">Image: Infoblox.</p></div> <p>In November 2024, researchers at the security firm <strong>Qurium</strong> published an investigation into &#8220;<a href="https://www.cybercom.mil/Media/News/Article/3895345/russian-disinformation-campaign-doppelgnger-unmasked-a-web-of-deception/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Doppelganger</a>,&#8221; a disinformation network that promotes pro-Russian narratives and infiltrates Europe&#8217;s media landscape by pushing fake news through a network of cloned websites.</p> <p>Doppelganger campaigns use specialized links that bounce the visitor&#8217;s browser through a long series of domains before the fake news content is served. Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">found</a> Doppelganger relies on a sophisticated &#8220;domain cloaking&#8221; service, a technology that allows websites to present different content to search engines compared to what regular visitors see. The use of cloaking services helps the disinformation sites remain online longer than they otherwise would, while ensuring that only the targeted audience gets to view the intended content.</p> <p>Qurium discovered that Doppelganger&#8217;s cloaking service also promoted online dating sites, and shared much of the same infrastructure with <strong>VexTrio</strong>, which is thought to be the oldest malicious traffic distribution system (TDS) in existence. While TDSs are commonly used by legitimate advertising networks to manage traffic from disparate sources and to track who or what is behind each click, VexTrio&#8217;s TDS largely manages web traffic from victims of phishing, malware, and social engineering scams.</p> <h2>BREAKING BAD</h2> <p>Digging deeper, Qurium noticed Doppelganger&#8217;s cloaking service used an Internet provider in Switzerland as the first entry point in a chain of domain redirections. They also noticed the same infrastructure hosted a pair of co-branded affiliate marketing services that were driving traffic to sketchy adult dating sites: <strong>LosPollos[.]com</strong> and <strong>TacoLoco[.]co</strong>.</p> <p>The LosPollos ad network incorporates many elements and references from the hit series &#8220;Breaking Bad,&#8221; mirroring the fictional &#8220;Los Pollos Hermanos&#8221; restaurant chain that served as a money laundering operation for a violent methamphetamine cartel.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71484" style="width: 759px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-71484" height="497" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_mainpage.png" width="749" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71484">The LosPollos advertising network invokes characters and themes from the hit show Breaking Bad. The logo for LosPollos (upper left) is the image of Gustavo Fring, the fictional chicken restaurant chain owner in the show.</p></div> <p>Affiliates who sign up with LosPollos are given JavaScript-heavy &#8220;<strong>smartlinks</strong>&#8221; that drive traffic into the VexTrio TDS, which in turn distributes the traffic among a variety of advertising partners, including dating services, sweepstakes offers, bait-and-switch mobile apps, financial scams and malware download sites.</p> <p>LosPollos affiliates typically stitch these smart links into <strong>WordPress</strong> websites that have been hacked via known vulnerabilities, and those affiliates will earn a small commission each time an Internet user referred by any of their hacked sites falls for one of these lures.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71485" style="width: 755px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-71485" height="321" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lospollos_subdomain_linkedIn_announcement.png" width="745" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71485">The Los Pollos advertising network promoting itself on LinkedIn.</p></div> <p>According to Qurium, TacoLoco is a traffic monetization network that uses deceptive tactics to trick Internet users into enabling &#8220;push notifications,&#8221; a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8030" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cross-platform browser standard</a> that allows websites to show pop-up messages which appear outside of the browser. For example, on Microsoft Windows systems these notifications typically show up in the bottom right corner of the screen — just above the system clock.</p> <p>In the case of VexTrio and TacoLoco, the notification approval requests themselves are deceptive — disguised as “CAPTCHA” challenges designed to distinguish automated bot traffic from real visitors. For years, VexTrio and its partners have successfully tricked countless users into enabling these site notifications, which are then used to continuously pepper the victim&#8217;s device with a variety of phony virus alerts and misleading pop-up messages.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71486" style="width: 759px;"><img alt="" class=" wp-image-71486" height="643" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/maliciouspushcaptcha.png" width="749" /><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71486">Examples of VexTrio landing pages that lead users to accept push notifications on their device.</p></div> <p>According to <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/godaddy-annual-cybersecurity-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a December 2024 annual report</a> from <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, <em>nearly 40 percent of compromised websites in 2024 redirected visitors to VexTrio via LosPollos smartlinks</em>.<span id="more-69927"></span></p> <h2>ADSPRO AND TEKNOLOGY</h2> <p>On November 14, 2024, Qurium <a href="https://www.qurium.org/forensics/when-kehr-meets-vextrio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published research</a> to support its findings that LosPollos and TacoLoco were services operated by <strong>Adspro Group</strong>, a company registered in the Czech Republic and Russia, and that Adspro runs its infrastructure at the Swiss hosting providers <strong>C41</strong> and <strong>Teknology SA</strong>.</p> <p>Qurium noted the LosPollos and TacoLoco sites state that their content is copyrighted by <strong>ByteCore AG</strong> and <strong>SkyForge Digital AG</strong>, both Swiss firms that are run by the owner of Teknology SA, <strong>Giulio Vitorrio Leonardo Cerutti</strong>. Further investigation revealed LosPollos and TacoLoco were apps developed by a company called <strong>Holacode</strong>, which lists Cerutti as its CEO.</p> <p>The apps marketed by Holacode include numerous VPN services, as well as one called <strong>Spamshield</strong> that claims to stop unwanted push notifications. But in January, Infoblox said they tested the app on their own mobile devices, and found it hides the user&#8217;s notifications, and then after 24 hours stops hiding them and demands payment. Spamshield subsequently changed its developer name from Holacode to <strong>ApLabz</strong>, although Infoblox noted that the Terms of Service for several of the rebranded ApLabz apps still referenced Holacode in their terms of service.</p> <p>Incredibly, Cerutti threatened to sue me for defamation before I&#8217;d even uttered his name or sent him a request for comment (Cerutti sent the unsolicited legal threat back in January after his company and my name were merely tagged in an Infoblox post on LinkedIn about VexTrio).</p> <p>Asked to comment on the findings by Qurium and Infoblox, Cerutti vehemently denied being associated with VexTrio. Cerutti asserted that his companies all strictly adhere to the regulations of the countries in which they operate, and that they have been completely transparent about all of their operations.</p> <p>&#8220;We are a group operating in the advertising and marketing space, with an affiliate network program,&#8221; Cerutti responded. &#8220;I am not [going] to say we are perfect, but I strongly declare we have no connection with VexTrio at all.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Unfortunately, as a big player in this space we also get to deal with plenty of publisher fraud, sketchy traffic, fake clicks, bots, hacked, listed and resold publisher accounts, etc, etc.,&#8221; Cerutti continued. &#8220;We bleed lots of money to such malpractices and conduct regular internal screenings and audits in a constant battle to remove bad traffic sources. It is also a highly competitive space, where some upstarts will often play dirty against more established mainstream players like us.&#8221;</p> <p>Working with Qurium, researchers at the security firm <strong>Infoblox</strong> released details about VexTrio&#8217;s infrastructure to their industry partners. Just four days after Qurium published its findings, LosPollos announced it was suspending its push monetization service. Less than a month later, Adspro had rebranded to <strong>Aimed Global</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71527" style="width: 760px;"><a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lp-mm.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-71527 " height="451" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/lp-mm.png" width="750" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71527">A mind map illustrating some of the key findings and connections in the Infoblox and Qurium investigations. Click to enlarge.</p></div> <h2>A REVEALING PIVOT</h2> <p>In March 2025, researchers at GoDaddy <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/resources/news/dollyway-malware-c2-tds" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chronicled</a> how <strong>DollyWay</strong> &#8212; a malware strain that has consistently redirected victims to VexTrio throughout its eight years of activity &#8212; suddenly stopped doing that on November 20, 2024. Virtually overnight, DollyWay and several other malware families that had previously used VexTrio began pushing their traffic through another TDS called <strong>Help TDS</strong>.</p> <p>Digging further into historical DNS records and the unique code scripts used by the Help TDS, Infoblox determined it has long enjoyed an exclusive relationship with VexTrio (at least until LosPollos ended its push monetization service in November).</p> <p>In <a href="https://blogs.infoblox.com/threat-intelligence/vexing-and-vicious-the-eerie-relationship-between-wordpress-hackers-and-an-adtech-cabal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report released today</a>, Infoblox said an exhaustive analysis of the JavaScript code, website lures, smartlinks and DNS patterns used by VexTrio and Help TDS linked them with at least four other TDS operators (not counting TacoLoco). Those four entities &#8212; <strong>Partners House</strong>, <strong>BroPush</strong>, <strong>RichAds</strong> and <strong>RexPush</strong> &#8212; are all Russia-based push monetization programs that pay affiliates to drive signups for a variety of schemes, but mostly online dating services.</p> <p>&#8220;As Los Pollos push monetization ended, we&#8217;ve seen an increase in fake CAPTCHAs that drive user acceptance of push notifications, particularly from Partners House,&#8221; the Infoblox report reads. &#8220;The relationship of these commercial entities remains a mystery; while they are certainly long-time partners redirecting traffic to one another, and they all have a Russian nexus, there is no overt common ownership.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Renee Burton</strong>, vice president of threat intelligence at Infoblox, said the security industry generally treats the deceptive methods used by VexTrio and other malicious TDSs as a kind of legally grey area that is mostly associated with less dangerous security threats, such as adware and scareware.</p> <p>But Burton argues that this view is myopic, and helps perpetuate a dark adtech industry that also pushes plenty of straight-up malware, noting that hundreds of thousands of compromised websites around the world every year redirect victims to the tangled web of VexTrio and VexTrio-affiliate TDSs.</p> <p>&#8220;These TDSs are a nefarious threat, because they&#8217;re the ones you can connect to the delivery of things like information stealers and scams that cost consumers billions of dollars a year,&#8221; Burton said. &#8220;From a larger strategic perspective, my takeaway is that Russian organized crime has control of malicious adtech, and these are just some of the many groups involved.&#8221;</p> <h2>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</h2> <p>As KrebsOnSecurity <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/11/be-very-sparing-in-allowing-site-notifications/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warned way back in 2020</a>, it&#8217;s a good idea to be very sparing in approving notifications when browsing the Web. In many cases these notifications are benign, but as we&#8217;ve seen there are numerous dodgy firms that are paying site owners to install their notification scripts, and then reselling that communications pathway to scammers and online hucksters.</p> <p>If you’d like to prevent sites from ever presenting notification requests, all of the major browser makers let you do this &#8212; either across the board or on a per-website basis. While it is true that blocking notifications entirely can break the functionality of some websites, doing this for any devices you manage on behalf of your less tech-savvy friends or family members might end up saving everyone a lot of headache down the road.</p> <p>To modify site notification settings in <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>, navigate to Settings, Privacy &amp; Security, Permissions, and click the &#8220;Settings&#8221; tab next to &#8220;Notifications.&#8221; That page will display any notifications already permitted and allow you to edit or delete any entries.

• Patch Tuesday, June 2025 Edition
  <p><strong>Microsoft</strong> today released security updates to fix at least 67 vulnerabilities in its <strong>Windows</strong> operating systems and software. Redmond warns that one of the flaws is already under active attack, and that software blueprints showing how to exploit a pervasive Windows bug patched this month are now public.</p> <p><img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-56287" height="527" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png" width="749" /></p> <p>The sole zero-day flaw this month is <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33053" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2025-33053</a>, a remote code execution flaw in the Windows implementation of <strong>WebDAV</strong> &#8212; an HTTP extension that lets users remotely manage files and directories on a server. While WebDAV isn&#8217;t enabled by default in Windows, its presence in legacy or specialized systems still makes it a relevant target, said <strong>Seth Hoyt</strong>, senior security engineer at <strong>Automox</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Adam Barnett</strong>, lead software engineer at <strong>Rapid7</strong>, said Microsoft&#8217;s advisory for CVE-2025-33053 does not mention that the Windows implementation of WebDAV is listed as deprecated since November 2023, which in practical terms means that the WebClient service no longer starts by default.</p> <p>&#8220;The advisory also has attack complexity as low, which means that exploitation does not require preparation of the target environment in any way that is beyond the attacker’s control,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;Exploitation relies on the user clicking a malicious link. It’s not clear how an asset would be immediately vulnerable if the service isn’t running, but all versions of Windows receive a patch, including those released since the deprecation of WebClient, like Server 2025 and Windows 11 24H2.&#8221;<span id="more-71465"></span></p> <p>Microsoft warns that an &#8220;elevation of privilege&#8221; vulnerability in the <strong>Windows Server Message Block</strong> (SMB) client (<a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-33073" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CVE-2025-33073</a>) is likely to be exploited, given that proof-of-concept code for this bug is now public. CVE-2025-33073 has a CVSS risk score of 8.8 (out of 10), and exploitation of the flaw leads to the attacker gaining &#8220;SYSTEM&#8221; level control over a vulnerable PC.</p> <p>&#8220;What makes this especially dangerous is that no further user interaction is required after the initial connection—something attackers can often trigger without the user realizing it,&#8221; said <strong>Alex Vovk</strong>, co-founder and CEO of <strong>Action1</strong>. &#8220;Given the high privilege level and ease of exploitation, this flaw poses a significant risk to Windows environments. The scope of affected systems is extensive, as SMB is a core Windows protocol used for file and printer sharing and inter-process communication.&#8221;</p> <p>Beyond these highlights, 10 of the vulnerabilities fixed this month were rated &#8220;critical&#8221; by Microsoft, including eight remote code execution flaws.</p> <p>Notably absent from this month&#8217;s patch batch is a fix for a newly discovered weakness in <strong>Windows Server 2025</strong> that allows attackers to act with the privileges of any user in Active Directory. The bug, dubbed &#8220;<strong>BadSuccessor</strong>,&#8221; was <a href="https://github.com/akamai/BadSuccessor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publicly disclosed</a> by researchers at <strong>Akamai</strong> on May 21, and several public proof-of-concepts are now available. Tenable&#8217;s Satnam Narang said organizations that have at least one Windows Server 2025 domain controller should review permissions for principals and limit those permissions as much as possible.</p> <p><strong>Adobe</strong> has released updates for <strong>Acrobat Reader</strong> and six other products addressing at least 259 vulnerabilities, most of them in an update for <strong>Experience Manager</strong>. <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> and <strong>Google Chrome</strong> both recently released security updates that require a restart of the browser to take effect. The latest Chrome update fixes two zero-day exploits in the browser (CVE-2025-5419 and CVE-2025-4664).</p> <p>For a detailed breakdown on the individual security updates released by Microsoft today, check out the <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20June%202025/32032" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patch Tuesday roundup</a> from the <strong>SANS Internet Storm Center</strong>.
