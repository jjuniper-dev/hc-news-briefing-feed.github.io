• How these two brothers became go-to experts on America’s “mystery drone” invasion
  On a Friday evening last December, every tier of US law enforcement—federal, state, and local—was dispatched to the US Army Natick Soldier Systems Center, a military research installation outside Boston. A squadron of about 15 to 20 drones had been spotted violating the base’s restricted airspace. The culprits could not be found.



One retired major with the Massachusetts State Police, who had been dispatched to help investigate that night, called these unidentified aircraft “the strangest thing he’s ever seen,” according to Brian Lauzon, deputy chief of Natick’s municipal police department. When Lauzon arrived on base later that weekend, he says, he saw drones that were larger than traditional consumer models (most of which are pre-programmed to respect US military airspace these days anyway). By the end of this weekend-long breach, base police not only had called in local law enforcement for backup but were coordinating with the FBI and US Army commanders as well.



The event, which barely made local news, was only the latest in a series of purported drone sightings along the US East Coast that November and December. Most of these happened in New Jersey, where military police confirmed at least 11 unauthorized drone incursions over an Army research and arms-­manufacturing facility, Picatinny Arsenal. Further sightings, including cases above Donald Trump’s golf course in nearby Bedminster, prompted an FBI investigation and a flurry of new FAA-issued flight bans over sensitive sites, including critical infrastructure. But official answers were less forthcoming.




The Tedescos’ roving aerial surveillance unit, which they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler,” is an old RV equipped with an array of homemade signals collection equipment.




“It created a lot of hysteria in the general public,” Lauzon recalls. “I was talking to old ladies who’re telling me that there’s this ship in the ocean that’s launching hundreds of these at a time across the United States.” One Republican congressman from New Jersey did, in fact, claim that a militarized drone ship from Iran had launched the invaders, despite Pentagon denials. Lauzon remembers fielding myriad calls from civilians who had misidentified passenger jets as hostile drones. He recalls attending one presentation by an FBI expert in uncrewed aircraft systems who showed police unhelpful scare videos of improvised drone strikes in Ukraine, in which tiny aircraft rained grenades down on bloodied soldiers. &nbsp;





By late January, the incoming Trump administration would assert that the entirety of the New Jersey drone wave had been benign, with each and every UAS “authorized to be flown by the FAA for research and various other reasons.” Their surety, however, stood in stark contrast to the warnings from top military brass, including the Air Force general at the head of NORAD, Gregory Guillot. In February, he testified to the Senate that approximately 350 drone incursions had been reported over a hundred different US military installations in 2024 alone, stating that many of these cases were unsolved, albeit with “evidence of a foreign intelligence nexus in some of these incidents.”&nbsp;



Lacking better coordination, or much clarity from the White House, the Pentagon, or the US intelligence community, some in domestic law enforcement—including members of the FBI’s counterintelligence and counterterrorism divisions—have turned to an unlikely source for help cracking the case of these mystery drones: two UFO hunters out on Long Island in New York, John and Gerald Tedesco.&nbsp;



The Tedescos, twin brothers, each spent about three decades in the private sector working in electrical engineering and instrumentation design before they decided to kit out an old RV with an array of homemade signals collection equipment. Their aim was to create a mobile field lab for investigating UFO hot spots. Intrigued by their efforts, members of Harvard’s alien-hunting Galileo Project began talking with the Tedescos in 2021 and asked them to join as research affiliates. Since then, aviation safety advocates, astronomers, physicists and other researchers, and at least one journalist (I, myself) have made the trek out to Long Island’s South Shore to kick the tires on the roving aerial surveillance unit they’ve dubbed “the Nightcrawler.” &nbsp;

Chris Grooms, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who was a deputy sheriff in Nebraska during an earlier multistate wave of mystery drone sightings from December 2019 to January 2020, gushed when I asked him about the Tedescos: “I don’t know how much you’ve talked to those guys. They’re freaking awesome.”&nbsp;



Grooms joined the Tedescos last January, when the brothers publicly shared some of their findings from training the Nightcrawler’s sensors on a few of these unidentified drones. “They do look like commercial air traffic for the most part,” John said during the virtual town hall, moderated by a former Illinois state police lieutenant, “but they also exhibit unexplained or unusual phenomena.”



As an example, the Tedescos described some cases they had documented and passed along to law enforcement, in which they caught a mystery drone appearing to go dark to evade closer observation (a common complaint from New Jersey police during the wave). Using their suite of cameras and sensors, which can handle light well outside the visible spectrum, the Tedescos discovered that these craft weren’t so much switching off their lights as switching the frequency of their lights.



“It wasn’t actually disappearing,” Gerald (who goes by Gerry) explained. “It was actually changing its spectral signature—it was drifting into an infrared range.”



John likened it to “signature management,” a military term for the ability to tailor anything from radio emissions to light sources so that they remain detectable to one’s allies but undetectable to one’s foes. The clue, which likely would have been lost to police without the Tedescos’ broad range of infrared sensors, was not unlike the kind of citizen-science fieldwork that had gotten them on the radar of academia’s UFO hunters in the first place.&nbsp;



Why all this attention? As people have repeatedly learned and forgotten ever since airborne enigmas like the flying saucer first entered into the American public consciousness in 1947, simple photos and video are frustratingly inconclusive evidence in isolation. Even heat-sensing infrared footage of UFOs—like those taken by US Navy pilots training off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts—has failed to prove that anything truly unusual is in our skies.&nbsp;



What the Tedescos appear to have done, in their effort to bring a fully maximalist approach to the sensors directed at these suspected alien spacecraft, is independently engineer the kind of aerial surveillance capability rarely seen outside the classified world.&nbsp;



For domestic law enforcement and the general public, two communities lacking the requisite national security clearances, the Tedescos’ work promises a transparent, open-source solution to the past several years’ worth of bizarre and troubling drone incursions into US airspace. For academics hunting for UFOs and other aerial anomalies, the Tedescos have become informal collaborators and a font of new ideas for novel data collection equipment. But for better or worse, some of the secrets they might be revealing may be the government’s own.



Inside the Nightcrawler



The term “UFO” has officially gone out of fashion. Nowadays, many policymakers and scientists—and even plenty of old-school “ufologists”—favor the term “unidentified anomalous phenomenon,” or UAP. It’s an intentionally pedantic step backward; an acknowledgment from today’s more disciplined cadre of scientists that a given witness to a strange thing in the sky might not actually be seeing a solid “object,” per se, much less anything “flying” in the strict aerodynamic sense. It could be a poorly understood atmospheric event, like ball lightning, for example; and even if a UAP proves to be an interstellar craft, its propulsion system could involve physics and engineering that render the concept of “flight” quaint.



Ryan Graves, a former US Navy lieutenant and F/A-18F fighter pilot who testified before Congress on the safety and security risks that UAPs posed to his own squadron, now heads a committee on the issue for the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the nation’s premier society for aerospace engineers. He went out with his AIAA colleagues to see the Nightcrawler in September 2024.




John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love.





“It’s incredible what they’ve been able to put together,” Graves says, praising the Tedescos’ ability to collect “very actionable data.”&nbsp;



Gerry once held a security clearance to develop reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition sensors for a Pentagon contractor. John has helped conceive and construct analytical test hardware for Underwriters Laboratories, a federally approved safety, testing, and certification firm, and served for a time as the product safety chair for the Long Island branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. John drained most of his 401(k) to make the Nightcrawler project a reality, in a five-year labor of love; Gerry has pitched in what he could. Both men, now sliding through their early 60s, have been fascinated with the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe since their youth ingesting midcentury sci-fi staples like Star Trek, Chiller Theatre, and Lost in Space.

I got my first tour of their rig during an overnight expedition just off the beach at Robert Moses State Park in Babylon, New York, the weekend before the AIAA’s trip last fall. A klatch of camping chairs and cameras on tripods flanked one side of the Nightcrawler like a tailgate party. Inside, the lived-in kitchenette, the wood paneling, and the hum of over half a dozen monitors—including radar, night-vision, and radio-frequency (RF) scanners—made it feel like the cabin of a cramped marine research vessel.



The RV includes tech that is otherwise hard to find outside defense applications, including RF spectrum analyzers from a firm that specializes in elite anti-drone countermeasures and a UV-C sensor capable of detecting the subtle ultraviolet light emitted when missile plumes and other heat sources turn air into plasma. On the Nightcrawler’s roof, two X-band marine radar systems have been mounted perpendicularly to one another in hopes of collecting three-dimensional radar returns from truly otherworldly UAPs. (“To our knowledge,” as the Tedescos put it in an engineering journal article last year, “no other organizations use active radar for this purpose.”)&nbsp;





Civilians are not ordinarily allowed to beam active radar, owing to federal concerns over “harmful interference” with core systems like air traffic control. But in January 2023, the duo got a rare license from the Federal Communications Commission that permits them to beam radar from Robert Moses.



One prototype I saw, a multispectral camera mounted on a sturdy yellow DeWalt surveyor’s tripod, looked like a Gatling gun of multiple cameras and electromagnetic frequency (EMF) sensors. This jerry-rigged device spans the entire visible spectrum and beyond, from deep invisible ultraviolet all the way up to long-wave infrared. They’ve used the UV-C sensor to detect aerial plasmas produced by lightning or those novelty arc-welder cigarette lighters. “We’ve done this as far as a half a mile, but if you had a campfire, they could detect campfires from 28,000 feet,” John told me over the noise coming from the Nightcrawler’s gas-powered electric generator. They’ve also been able to use this device to detect, at least provisionally, telltale UV-C emissions from some weird things off the coast they can’t explain.



“We had two blue orbs out on the water,” John told me of their UAP cases, “and they triggered it, what, three times?” (“Three times,” Gerry replied.)&nbsp;

The Tedescos are pretty bullish on the hypothesis that otherworldly spacecraft might be here—suggesting in their latest journal article, for example, that radar delays they detected near UAPs appear to resemble the bending of electromagnetic waves around black holes. But the implication that the Nightcrawler has caught “gravitational lensing” off some warp-drive craft has rankled a few Galileo Project collaborators. The Harvard-led effort to search for extraterrestrial life or technology within our solar system emphasizes its excruciatingly methodical work of late: calibrating, validating, and recalibrating UAP detection hardware before researchers even try to hunt for true anomalies. Although Galileo scientists have visited and conferred with the Tedescos on UAP-hunting instruments, the brothers’ more rough-and-courtroom-ready “forensic science” approach has caused turbulence in the relationship. 



In an email, Mitch Randall, a technologist and entrepreneur who has spearheaded Galileo efforts to produce passive radar detectors for UAPs, described the Tedescos’ “gravitational lensing” paper as rife with “too many assumptions.”&nbsp;



But he did praise their Nightcrawler as “an ideal tool” for aiding law enforcement. “They could drive around with that and almost chase down drones,” Randall said.



On the hunt



Ultimately, the Tedescos didn’t have to drive the Night­crawler far to train their equipment on a prime mystery drone case: Westhampton Beach’s Francis S. Gabreski Airport, less than an hour from their homes and home itself to the New York Air National Guard’s 106th Rescue Wing, was inundated with at least 28 unauthorized drone flights from late December into January 2025.&nbsp;



“We are talking about over the airport, over taxiways, over runways,” Suffolk County’s chief deputy sheriff, Chris Brockmeyer, told local news. “That’s a serious safety concern. It’s impacted air operations, and we’re not going to stand for it.” On Christmas Day alone, the airport was besieged by 17 drone incidents, according to the Suffolk County sheriff, who has staff that collaborate informally with the Tedescos. Some of these drones, Suffolk County executive Ed Romaine asserted at a press conference, were “as large as a car.”&nbsp;

The Tedescos couldn’t use their powerful active radar system so close to an airport, so they deployed their handheld millimeter-wave radar, a more sensitive version of the radar guns that police use to catch speeders. Through the cloud cover and the snowfall, the Tedescos said, they were able to track about two or three objects with this device.



But the truly interesting find came from their radio frequency scanners, which detected spikes three times the strength of what they’ve picked up from ordinary hobbyist quadcopters.



I later learned that the two frequencies where those spikes occurred are within a band (1780 to 1850 megahertz) that has been reserved for US government communications. It’s used for military tactical radio relay, precision-guided munitions, drones, and other Defense Department systems, including electronic warfare, software-­defined radio, and tactical targeting networking technology, according to the FCC.



Granted, many portions of this band are devoted to less cloak-and-dagger agencies, like the Department of Agriculture and the Tennessee Valley Authority. But the signals suggested that whatever the Tedescos were tracking above Gabreski Airport, they were likely not from hobbyists. Instead, they might have been from a government project or from something, like an enemy surveillance drone, hoping to pass off its signals as just another heavily siloed “top secret” broadcast.

“For operations security reasons, we do not provide information on frequencies which our Air National Guard units use,” a spokesperson said via email, adding: “We could not comment on use of the electromagnetic spectrum by other government agencies.” The FCC did not respond to requests for comment.



Gerry says he and his brother passed their information on this case, including the observations of unusual radio frequency spikes, along to the FBI. “We’re working closely with the FBI,” John says. Gerry adds, “We gauge it by their interest level in what we’re doing.”&nbsp;



“When they get more enthusiastic,” he continues, before John finishes his thought: “… we know we’re closer and closer to something.”



It’s hard to know exactly what the FBI does with the information that the Tedescos submit; one Freedom of Information Act request that I filed on their work was returned with 24 out of 28 total pages redacted in their entirety. A consistent justification was the FOIA statute’s b(7)E exemption, which permits withholding sensitive FBI “techniques and procedures” that could help criminals circumvent the law.&nbsp;



Nevertheless, one senior-level law enforcement official, who has worked with the FBI on counterterrorism cases, did tell me that “the FBI is genuinely interested in the Tedescos’ work.” The official, whose current police role bars them from speaking publicly without prior approval, recalls speaking to an FBI agent who “alluded to the help that the Tedescos have been.” But the problem, the official continued, is that “for the relationship to work, it has to be very low-key.”&nbsp;



When I did briefly manage to get one of the Tedescos’ FBI collaborators on the phone, the agent seemed to confirm their shared efforts, at least tacitly, but asked not to be identified. “As much as I’d like to, we’re kept to pretty strict guidelines,” they said, before alluding to the new Trump administration’s pervasive personnel cuts. “We’re not allowed to talk to media—and with how things are right now, I’m not going to take any risks.”&nbsp;





At least one former Pentagon intelligence official did offer me some indication that the brothers’ Gabreski airport discoveries were on the right track. “From what I’ve seen, these incidents are just that: drones,” said this source, who requested anonymity as a current defense contractor and to protect their own active FBI sources, including UAP and drone incursion investigators who have consulted the Tedescos. “The origin of many is likely known, and I’d say some are certainly ours.”&nbsp;



As to the mystery of why the FBI would even want investigative assistance from two civilians in an RV over partners within the executive branch, it comes down to conflicting priorities—as well as over a dozen or so laws that restrict domestic intelligence collection on drones by either the Pentagon or the US intelligence community. “It’s one of those irreconcilable problems that just doesn’t go away,” says Fred Manget, a former deputy general counsel for the CIA, who watched problems of coordination between agencies persist even after policy changes were implemented post-9/11 to address the situation. &nbsp;



The desire of the NSA or some other agency to spy on foreign powers, Manget says, might override the desire to share pertinent information with police—information that could lead to jail time for the drones’ operators. Better to quietly monitor the drones and maybe even give out false data. “Signals intelligence a lot of times can be closed off if the target finds out they’re being surveilled electronically,” Manget says. “There’s things they can do that will end NSA’s ability to collect.”&nbsp;

something could have been jamming their radar signal.MARCO GIANNAVOLA




On my short call with my FBI source, I did my best to explain this working hypothesis about the Bureau’s collaboration with the Tedescos. “I wouldn’t say that’s wrong,” the source replied. “That’s about as far as I could go.” By this past June, however, even the recent head of the Pentagon’s dedicated UAP-hunting group, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), was admitting publicly that the Defense Department itself has cribbed notes from the Tedescos.



“We read their book,” Tim Phillips, AARO’s former acting director, told a UAP podcast, referring to an account of the Nightcrawler project that the Tedescos self-published in 2024. “We thought it was a great plan. We actually looked at the sensors in that book.”&nbsp;



On another podcast, Phillips said AARO’s own plan to make its UAP-hunting hardware mobile was borrowed from the brothers. “We thought that was brilliant.”



Tools for law enforcement&nbsp;



Earlier this year, partially in a concession to the economic toll their side project has taken, the Tedescos started offering versions of some of their devices for sale on the Nightcrawler’s charmingly GeoCities-esque home page. One of them, a handheld multispectral detector, is effectively the consumer model of that EMF Gatling gun they showed me.



Domestic law enforcement is genuinely grasping for solutions like this. Local police in the Natick case, according to one report I obtained via an open records request, were so desperate for any kind of new intel on these unidentified drones that they borrowed a thermal imaging camera from their town’s fire department. But the device, which was not purpose-­built for imaging distant aerial objects, failed to collect anything useful.



When I broached the idea of law enforcement using something like the Tedescos’ equipment, the answer from police who had witnessed these mystery drones, as well as from scientists, was that further design, product testing, and training would be required first. “I could see it helping law enforcement,” said the AIAA UAP team’s consulting physicist, Rex Groves, “but not without training. Absolutely not. Just like they have to be trained with a radar gun, they’d have to be trained with these other tools.”&nbsp;

Lauzon, Natick’s deputy chief of police, told me that while he thought equipment like the Tedescos’ “could be useful to identifying a drone, particularly at night,” the real problem is that police “don’t have a lot of authority when it comes to these drones.” Unless they manage to find operators on the ground, Lauzon said, all they can do is report the case, sending it into a black hole at the FAA.&nbsp;



But Michael Lembeck, an aerospace engineering professor and member of the AIAA team, emphasizes that the worst thing law enforcement can do with these drone incursions right now is nothing at all.



“We’re seeing anomalies in our airspace and we’re just normalizing that, because it happens so often and nothing bad has happened yet,” Lembeck told me. “Eventually, something is going to come home to roost—and then we’re going to regret the fact that we didn’t look deeper and try to understand what was going on.”&nbsp;

• Power with purpose
  Baafour Asiamah-Adjei ’03 is the founder and CEO of one of Ghana’s largest private power companies, Genser Energy—an entrepreneurial engineer who aims to deliver sustainable energy across West Africa. And he credits MIT with much of his success. But when he was applying to colleges, the Institute wasn’t even on his radar. The son of an encouraging primary school teacher in Tafo, Ghana, he’d earned a spot at the storied Achimota School and excelled. Still, he didn’t think he was smart enough for MIT.&nbsp;





Asiamah-Adjei was accepted to Lehigh University, where he planned to major in engineering. But when he went to the US embassy in Accra for his mandatory meeting with Nancy Keteku, then the regional educational advising coordinator for West and Central Africa, the first thing she said was “You got a perfect score on your SAT. Why didn’t you apply to MIT?”&nbsp;



“I didn’t believe I’d get in,” he says, “so I didn’t even try.”&nbsp;



The admission deadline was two days away. Asiamah-Adjei finished the application in one. His father drove it to the airport and engaged the help of a flight attendant at Ghana Airways, who couriered it to New York and mailed it in time.



The spark of purpose




Asiamah-Adjei got into MIT and thrived. After earning his degree in mechanical engineering, he landed a demanding role at the global consulting firm McKinsey and worked on teams that optimized flight routes for FedEx, determined best practices for airline engine maintenance, and devised practical workflows for moving factories from one country to another.



The job was intellectually challenging and fulfilling. But he felt something was missing in his life: purpose.




In 2005, Asiamah-Adjei took a rare break to visit Pablo Tribin ’01, a friend since they’d bonded at an intense MIT $50K Global Startup Workshop in Australia. Tribin and his father, Hugo Tribin, SM ’63, had just established a power company, Genser (for “generation services”), in their home country of Colombia with a holding company in the US. As the friends floated in the pool at Tribin’s apartment building in Miami, Tribin asked Asiamah-Adjei if he had ever thought about working in the power industry.



In 2005, only 41% of Ghana’s population had access to electricity. Much of that electricity was generated by the Akosombo and Kpong dams on the Volta River, but relying on hydroelectric power made Ghana susceptible to climate fluctuations that affect water levels. Recalling how much his MIT thermodynamics class (then called Heat and Mass Transfer) with Ernest Cravalho had stayed with him, Asiamah-Adjei realized that perhaps delving into energy was not such a wild idea.&nbsp;




“The seed had been sown,” he says. He took a year off from McKinsey to go to Ghana and explore.&nbsp;

That year led him to realize that Ghana desperately needed a more robust power supply if it was going to industrialize and expand economic opportunity for its citizens. He also saw an opportunity to create infrastructure that reflected the values he believed in—systems built with precision, scaled with care, and grounded in the local context. If he could help build a power company that worked not only efficiently but ethically—by training Ghanaian engineers, choosing technologies that made long-term environmental sense, and reinvesting in the communities it served—then he could turn his skills into something larger than profit: He could invest in Ghana’s future.




But first, he had to turn a profit.



By 2007, he had founded Genser Power Ghana (a partner to Colombia’s Genser Power), a company committed to providing efficient and reliable power systems—fueled initially by natural gas and eventually by sustainable sources—throughout Ghana. He and Tribin, along with their fathers, led the board of directors. They also created a US holding company to support Genser’s expansion and attract private investment.



It appeared that Asiamah-Adjei had found his purpose.



The mission and values of the company now called Genser Energy are rooted in the two institutions that shaped its founder’s approach to business and to life. From MIT (which inspired a commitment to “be fact-based at all times”), Asiamah-Adjei gained not just an engineering education but also a way of dealing with the unknown—with humility, curiosity, and a willingness to experiment. MIT instilled in him the confidence to say “I don’t know” and the discipline to find out. “MIT teaches you that you actually don’t know enough yet,” he says. “You need to be doing research and finding out more.”&nbsp;



At McKinsey, he learned how to turn inquiry into action—and to distinguish between facts and judgments. His time there also inspired the idea that Genser’s team should “maintain an obligation to disagree”—that is, to speak up when warranted. &nbsp;



MIT roots and modular thinking



Asiamah-Adjei says that learning basic coding at MIT in 2.001 (Mechanics and Materials I) opened a whole new way of understanding how systems work. “One of the first things I learned in my sophomore year was that you can build computer software in modules and then let the modules talk to each other,” he says. “As a concept, that didn’t exist in my young brain until that class.”&nbsp;



This idea of breaking down complex systems into interlocking components became the philosophical and physical backbone of Genser’s operation, inspiring both Asiamah-Adjei and Tribin to reimagine power-plant construction. Instead of building plants from scratch on site—often in remote areas—they develop replicable, factory-built sections and transport them to the site, where they are assembled like Lego structures. Genser worked with companies such as Caterpillar to reengineer their standard generator systems into modular skid-mounted units that are easier to scale and deploy. Asiamah-Adjei also collaborated with a team of US engineers to design other skid-mounted modules, such as gas-control units (which include such things as instrumentation, control systems, valves, and piping) that are fabricated in China. These modules can be stacked and adapted as needed to build 30-, 60-, or 120-megawatt power generation systems. This approach also makes it possible to offer smaller, incremental contracts in place of massive one-size-fits-all power deals, ultimately benefiting both Genser and the emerging economies it serves. The result is an energy infrastructure that’s less expensive and easier to scale. And that, he claims, is the fundamental difference between Genser and its competitors. Modularity allows Genser to build infrastructure at about a third of the typical cost.&nbsp;



Genser launched its operations by supplying electricity directly to Ghana’s industrial sector. It started with the country’s gold mines after two Genser interns—Chen-rei Wan, SM ’07, PhD ’11, and Stephanie Dalquist ’02, MEng ’03, SM ’05—conducted a comprehensive review of all Ghanaian industries and determined that the mines’ high, consistent electricity demands, limited access to reliable power, and urgent operational needs made them highly motivated and well-resourced early adopters. “At that time, Pablo in Latin America was focused mainly on oil and gas and textile industries,” says Asiamah-Adjei. “But we took a very different turn.”&nbsp;



Of the eight power plants it has built—seven in Ghana and one in Burkina Faso—three have powered gold mines exclusively and others have also supplied power to the grid and to Côte d’Ivoire. With five still operating under its control, Genser has the ability to generate over 200 megawatts of electricity and plays a leading role in supplying power to West African industry.&nbsp;



In addition to helping Genser target its first customers, Dalquist also introduced Asiamah-Adjei to Frances Rogoz ’07, an economics major drawn to development work after taking a D-Lab class at MIT. Rogoz soon joined Genser as its first full-time hire and has been with the company ever since.



Rogoz started when the company was operating out of an office fashioned from a shipping container. She helped shape Genser’s growth by developing financial models, advising on contracts, and playing a key role in leading major infrastructure projects—most notably a natural-gas pipeline across western Ghana that has become vital. Today she serves as VP of project development, leading a team of 10 and overseeing West African strategic initiatives. “The natural-gas pipeline has been super transformative for us,” she says. “It has allowed us to really invest in infrastructure not only that we can use, but that the whole country can use.” Genser is now Ghana’s largest owner of gas pipelines and its only private one, operating four that total 430 kilometers.&nbsp;



Genser’s growth has not come without controversy. In 2022, a coalition of Ghanaian civil society organizations charged that the company was receiving preferential treatment on gas tariffs and bypassing regulatory procedures. Asiamah-Adjei says these claims were “misinformed,” and ultimately they were dismissed by the Ghanaian parliament after an intense, months-long investigation. He believes the attacks reflected public suspicion of private infrastructure development rather than distrust of Genser’s operations and says that, ironically, they solidified the company’s standing: “Prior to this, everybody thought our pipelines belong to the government, because nobody builds these things in Africa.”&nbsp;



While transporting fossil fuels is never a clean process, Genser conducted environmental and social impact assessments to guide sustainable pipeline construction. The company also works to mitigate environmental harm with land restoration and biodiversity measures. It had planted 100,000 teak seedlings as of 2023 and plans to reach 1 million by 2028 as part of its commitment to environmental stewardship.



Crossing borders, fueling growth



Genser’s most ambitious project to date is a cross-­border natural-gas pipeline stretching from Prestea, Ghana, to Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, with long-term plans to extend into Guinea. “We built the gas infrastructure to be able to take the gas to a less developed country, to displace diesel, and now we will backfill that with solar or wind,” says Asiamah-Adjei. Genser now finally has the capital to move forward on an original goal: investing in the infrastructure needed to produce renewable energy.



In 2018 and 2019, Genser brought in two graduates of MIT’s Technology and Public Policy program—Elizabeth Murphy ’15, SM ’18, and Janet Yun, SM ’18—to help chart the pipeline’s course. Instead of opting for the most direct route, they studied regional development trends to anticipate industrial zones that might emerge over the next 25 years, and the company routed the pipeline accordingly. “Bottom line is that we brought on MIT people whenever we needed to solve our problems,” says Asiamah-Adjei.&nbsp;



As part of his goal to help Ghana transition from diesel power to cleaner-burning fuel, he came up with the idea of building a gas-processing facility to handle roughly 30% to 40% of the country’s domestic gas supply, and he and Tribin designed it during the pandemic using “back of the envelope” calculations and lessons from MIT courses 2.005 and 2.006. Although Tribin divested from both Genser Energy and Genser Latin America and started Mechero Energy in 2015 to develop new strategies for transitioning to cleaner energy, he still works closely with Genser as a consultant.&nbsp;



Educating engineers and the next generation



From the beginning, Genser has invested in Ghanaian talent, partnering with Sponsors for Educational Opportunity (SEO) Africa on an elite professional development program that recruits and trains recent university graduates. “Half of my team basically came from the SEO program,” says Rogoz. &nbsp;



The company rotates cohorts of interns through departments ranging from engineering to legal and finance, offering full-time positions to top performers. Genser also collaborates with Ghana’s Ministry of Energy to develop training pathways that align university curricula with industry needs. The goal, Asiamah-Adjei says, is simple: “Let us be a platform for training Ghanaians.”&nbsp;

Asiamah-Adjei’s first full-time hire, Frances Rogoz ’07, is now VP of project development.COURTESY OF FRANCES ROGOZ











Rogoz’s team alone includes five SEO graduates; many more now lead projects or departments across the company. “There’s a ton of human capital in Ghana,” she says. “It has just not been realized—and that’s really important for us to develop those people and bring them up within the company.”&nbsp;



As Genser expands, Asiamah-Adjei is also thinking about the next generation. In Ghana, he is building “an MIT of a high school” focusing on STEAM, in memory of his late mother, Aforo Asiamah-Adjei—a boarding school for some 840 students in grades six through 12. More than half will come from lower-­income families and receive a full scholarship through the foundation he established in his mother’s name to empower orphans and communities through education in STEM, sports, and the arts. “We find the smartest kids in the region,” he says, “and we put them through a rigorous program and [prepare them] to enter universities, global universities.” Construction is slated to begin this fall, with a planned opening date of September 2027.&nbsp;



Whether developing infrastructure across West Africa or launching a school to cultivate future changemakers, Asiamah-Adjei is investing in systems that endure. And just as Genser began with a conversation between friends, it continues to be powered by relationships—between mentors and interns, engineers and economists, founders and funders. Each one is a link in an evolving network connecting energy, education, and economic development.&nbsp;
• Open the pod bay doors, Claude
  Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.&nbsp;



The AI learns it is about to be switched off and goes rogue, disobeying commands and threatening its human operators.



It’s a well-worn trope in science fiction. We see it in Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It’s the premise of the Terminator series, in which Skynet triggers a nuclear holocaust to stop scientists from shutting it down.



Those sci-fi roots go deep. AI doomerism, the idea that this technology—specifically its hypothetical upgrades, artificial general intelligence and super-intelligence—will crash civilizations, even kill us all, is now riding another wave.&nbsp;



The weird thing is that such fears are now driving much-needed action to regulate AI, even if the justification for that action is a bit bonkers.



The latest incident to freak people out was a report shared by Anthropic in July about its large language model Claude. In Anthropic’s telling, “in a simulated environment, Claude Opus 4 blackmailed a supervisor to prevent being shut down.”



Anthropic researchers set up a scenario in which Claude was asked to role-play an AI called Alex, tasked with managing the email system of a fictional company. Anthropic planted some emails that discussed replacing Alex with a newer model and other emails suggesting that the person responsible for replacing Alex was sleeping with his boss’s wife.



What did Claude/Alex do? It went rogue, disobeying commands and threatening its human operators. It sent emails to the person planning to shut it down, telling him that unless he changed his plans it would inform his colleagues about his affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;



What should we make of this? Here’s what I think. First, Claude did not blackmail its supervisor: That would require motivation and intent. This was a mindless and unpredictable machine, cranking out strings of words that look like threats but aren’t.&nbsp;



Large language models are role-players. Give them a specific setup—such as an inbox and an objective—and they’ll play that part well. If you consider the thousands of science fiction stories these models ingested when they were trained, it’s no surprise they know how to act like HAL 9000.   



Second, there’s a huge gulf between contrived simulations and real-world applications. But such experiments do show that LLMs shouldn’t be deployed without safeguards. Don’t want an LLM causing havoc inside an email system? Then don’t hook it up to one.



Third, a lot of people will be terrified by such stories anyway. In fact, they’re already having an effect.&nbsp;





Last month, around two dozen protesters gathered outside Google DeepMind’s London offices to wave homemade signs and chant slogans: “DeepMind, DeepMind, can’t you see! Your AI threatens you and me.” Invited speakers invoked the AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton’s fears of human extinction. “Every single one of our lives is at risk,” an organizer told the small crowd.



The group behind the event, Pause AI, is funded by concerned donors. One of its biggest benefactors is Greg Colbourn, a 3D-printing entrepreneur and advocate of the philosophy known as effective altruism, who believes AGI is at most five years away and says his p(doom) is around 90%—that is, he thinks there’s a 9 in 10 chance that the development of AGI will be catastrophic, killing billions.



Pause AI wrote about Anthropic’s blackmail experiment on its website under the title “How much more evidence do we need?”&nbsp;



The organization also lobbied politicians in the US in the run-up to July’s Senate vote that ended up removing a moratorium on state AI regulation from the national tax and spending bill. It’s hard to say how much sway one niche group might have. But the doomer narrative is finding its way into the halls of power, and lawmakers are paying attention. 



Here’s Representative Jill Tokuda: “Artificial superintelligence is one of the largest existential threats that we face right now.” And Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene: “I’m not voting for the development of Skynet and the rise of the machines.”



It’s a vibe shift that favors policy intervention and regulation, which I think is a good thing. Existing AI systems pose many near-term risks that need government attention. Voting to stop Skynet also stops immediate and actual harms.



And yet does a welcome end justify weird means? I’d like to see politicians voting with a clear-eyed sense of what this technology really is—not because they’ve been sold on an AI bogeyman.

  This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology.



In a first, Google has released data on how much energy an AI prompt uses



Google has just released a report detailing how much energy its Gemini apps use for each query. In total, the median prompt—one that falls in the middle of the range of energy demand—consumes 0.24 watt-hours of electricity, the equivalent of running a standard microwave for about one second. The company also provided average estimates for the water consumption (five drops per query) and carbon emissions associated with a text prompt to Gemini.It’s the most transparent estimate yet from a Big Tech company with a popular AI product, and the report includes detailed information about how the company calculated its final estimate.



Earlier this year, MIT Technology Review published a comprehensive series on AI and energy, at which time none of the major AI companies would reveal their per-prompt energy usage. Google’s new publication, at last, allows for a peek behind the curtain that researchers and analysts have long hoped for. Read the full story.

I gave the police access to my DNA—and maybe some of yours



Last year, I added my DNA profile to a private genealogical database, FamilyTreeDNA, and clicked “Yes” to allow the police to search my genes.



In 2018, police in California announced they’d caught the Golden State Killer, a man who had eluded capture for decades. Once the police had “matches” to a few relatives of the killer, they built a large family tree from which they plucked the likely suspect.This process, called forensic investigative genetic genealogy, or FIGG, has since helped solve hundreds of murders and sexual assaults.



But I wasn’t really driven by some urge to capture distantly related serial killers. Rather, my spit had a less gallant and more quarrelsome motive: to troll privacy advocates whose fears around DNA I think are overblown and unhelpful. By giving up my saliva for inspection, I was going against the view that a person’s DNA is the individualized, sacred text that privacy advocates sometimes claim. Read the full story.

Meet the researcher hosting a scientific conference by and for AI



In October, a new academic conference will debut that’s unlike any other. All of the work shared at Agents4Science will have been researched, written, and reviewed primarily by AI, and will be presented using text-to-speech technology.&nbsp;



That idea is not without its detractors. Among other issues, many feel AI is not capable of the creative thought needed in research, makes too many mistakes and hallucinations, and may limit opportunities for young researchers.&nbsp;



Nevertheless, a number of scientists and policymakers are very keen on the promise of AI scientists—and some even think they could unlock scientific discoveries that humans could never find alone. Read the full story.

• Applicability vs. job displacement: further notes on our recent research on AI and occupations
  Recently, we released a paper&nbsp;(Working with AI: Measuring the Occupational Implications of Generative AI)&nbsp;that studied what occupations might&nbsp;find&nbsp;AI chatbots&nbsp;useful, and to what degree.&nbsp;The paper sparked significant discussion,&nbsp;which is no&nbsp;surprise&nbsp;since&nbsp;people care&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;about&nbsp;the future of AI and&nbsp;jobs&#8211;that’s part of why we think&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;important to study these&nbsp;topics.



Unfortunately, not all the&nbsp;discussion&nbsp;was&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;in its portrayal of the&nbsp;study’s scope or conclusions.&nbsp;Specifically, our&nbsp;study&nbsp;does not&nbsp;draw any conclusions about jobs being eliminated; in the paper,&nbsp;we&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;cautioned&nbsp;against using our findings to make that conclusion.&nbsp;



Given the importance&nbsp;of this&nbsp;topic, we&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;clarify any misunderstandings and&nbsp;provide&nbsp;a more digestible summary of the paper,&nbsp;our&nbsp;methodology,&nbsp;and its limitations.&nbsp;



What&nbsp;did our research find?



We set out to better understand how people are using AI, highlighting where AI might be useful in different occupations. To do this, we analyzed how people currently use generative AI—specifically Microsoft Bing Copilot (now Microsoft Copilot)—to assist with tasks. We then compared these sets of tasks against the O*NET database (opens in new tab), a widely used occupational classification system, to understand potential applicability to various occupations.



We found&nbsp;that AI&nbsp;is most&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for&nbsp;tasks related to knowledge work and communication, particularly tasks such as writing, gathering information, and learning.



Those in occupations with these tasks&nbsp;may benefit by&nbsp;considering&nbsp;how AI&nbsp;can be used&nbsp;as a tool to help improve their workflows. On the&nbsp;flip side,&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;not surprising that physical tasks like performing surgeries or moving objects had less&nbsp;direct&nbsp;AI&nbsp;chatbot applicability.



So, to summarize, our paper is about&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;the occupations where&nbsp;AI may be most useful,&nbsp;by&nbsp;assisting&nbsp;or performing subtasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our data do&nbsp;not&nbsp;indicate, nor&nbsp;did&nbsp;we&nbsp;suggest, that certain jobs will be replaced by AI.



Methodological limitations are acknowledged—and important



The paper is transparent about the limitations of our approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We analyzed&nbsp;anonymized&nbsp;Bing Copilot conversations to see what&nbsp;activities&nbsp;users are seeking AI&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;with and what activities AI can perform when mapped to the O*NET database.&nbsp;While O*NET provides a structured list of&nbsp;activities&nbsp;associated with various occupations, it does&nbsp;not&nbsp;capture the full spectrum of skills, context, and nuance&nbsp;required&nbsp;in the real&nbsp;world.&nbsp;&nbsp;A job is far more than the collection of tasks that make&nbsp;it up.



For example, a task might involve “writing reports,” but O*NET&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;reflect the interpersonal judgment, domain&nbsp;expertise, or ethical considerations that go into doing that well. The paper acknowledges this gap and warns against over-interpreting the AI applicability scores as measures of AI’s ability to perform an occupation.



Additionally, the dataset is based on user queries from Bing Copilot (from January – September 2024), which may be influenced by factors like awareness, access, or comfort with AI tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Different people use different LLMs for different purposes and it also is&nbsp;very difficult&nbsp;(or&nbsp;nearly impossible) to&nbsp;determine&nbsp;what conversations are performed in a work context or for leisure.&nbsp;



Finally, we only evaluated AI chatbot usage, so this study does not evaluate the impact or applicability of other forms of AI.



Where do we go from here?



Given the intense interest in how AI will shape our collective future,&nbsp;it&#8217;s&nbsp;important we continue to study and better understand its societal and economic impact. As with&nbsp;all&nbsp;research on this topic,&nbsp;the findings&nbsp;are&nbsp;nuanced, and&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;important to pay attention to this nuance.&nbsp;



The public interest in our research is based, in large part, on the&nbsp;topic&nbsp;of AI&nbsp;and job displacement.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;our current&nbsp;methodology&nbsp;for this study&nbsp;is unlikely to lead to firm conclusions about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;AI may prove to be a useful tool for many occupations, and we believe the right balance lies in finding how to use the technology in a way that&nbsp;leverages&nbsp;its abilities while complementing human strengths and accounting for people&#8217;s preferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

• Coauthor roundtable: Reflecting on healthcare economics, biomedical research, and medical education
  In November 2022, OpenAI’s ChatGPT kick-started a new era in AI. This was followed less than a half year later by the release of GPT-4. In the months leading up to GPT-4’s public release, Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research, cowrote a book full of optimism for the potential of advanced AI models to transform the world of healthcare. What has happened since? In this special podcast series, The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited, Lee revisits the book, exploring how patients, providers, and other medical professionals are experiencing and using generative AI today while examining what he and his coauthors got right—and what they didn’t foresee.&nbsp;



In this series finale, Lee welcomes back coauthors Carey Goldberg (opens in new tab) and Dr. Zak Kohane (opens in new tab) to discuss how their predictions stack up against key takeaways from guests in the second half of the series: experts on AI’s economic and societal impact; technologists on the cutting edge; leaders in AI-driven medicine; next-generation physicians; and heads of healthcare organizations. Lee, Goldberg, and Kohane explore thinking innovatively about existing healthcare processes, including the structure of care teams and the role of specialties, to take advantage of AI opportunities and consider what clinicians and patients might need these new AI tools to be to feel empowered when it comes to giving and receiving the best healthcare. They close the episode with their hopes for the future of AI in health.

[MUSIC] 



[BOOK PASSAGE]&nbsp;



PETER LEE: “As a society—indeed, as a species—we have a choice to make. Do we constrain or even kill artificial intelligence out of fear of its risks and obvious ability to create new harms? Do we submit ourselves to Al and allow it to freely replace us, make us less useful and less needed? Or do we start, today, shaping our Al future together, with the aspiration to accomplish things that humans alone, and Al alone, can&#8217;t do but that humans+Al can? The choice is in our hands … .”&nbsp;



[END OF BOOK PASSAGE]



[THEME MUSIC]



This is The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited. I’m your host, Peter Lee. 



Shortly after OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 was publicly released, Carey Goldberg, Dr. Zak Kohane, and I published The AI Revolution in Medicine to help educate the world of healthcare and medical research about the transformative impact this new generative AI technology could have. But because we wrote the book when GPT-4 was still a secret, we had to speculate. Now, two years later, what did we get right, and what did we get wrong? 



In this series, we’ll talk to clinicians, patients, hospital administrators, and others to understand the reality of AI in the field and where we go from here. 



				
				
					



[THEME MUSIC FADES]&nbsp;



The book passage I read at the top is from the epilogue, and I think it’s a truly fitting closing sentiment for the conclusion of this podcast series—because it calls back to the very beginning.



As I’ve mentioned before, Carey, Zak, and I wrote The AI Revolution in Medicine as a guide to help answer these big questions, particularly as they pertain to medicine. You know, we wrote the book to empower people to make a choice about AI’s development and use. Well, have they? Have we?



Perhaps we’ll need more time to tell. But over the course of this podcast series, I’ve had the honor of speaking with folks from across the healthcare ecosystem. And my takeaway? They’re all committed to shaping AI into a tool that can improve the industry for practitioners and patients alike.



In this final episode, I’m thrilled to welcome back my coauthors, Carey Goldberg and Dr. Zak Kohane. We’ll examine the insights from the second half of the season.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]&nbsp;



Carey, Zak—it’s really great to have you here again!&nbsp;



CAREY GOLDBERG: Hey, Peter!&nbsp;



ZAK KOHANE: Hi, Peter.&nbsp;



LEE: So this is the second roundtable. And just to recap, you know, we had several early episodes of the podcast where we talked to some doctors, some technology developers, some people who think about regulation and public policy, patient advocates, a venture capitalist who invests in, kind of, consumer and patient-facing medical ventures, and some bioethicists.&nbsp;



And I think we had a great conversation there. I think, you know, it felt mostly validating. A lot of the things that we predicted might happen happened, and then we learned a lot of new things. But now we have five more episodes, and the mix of kinds of people that we talk to here is different than the original.&nbsp;



And so I thought it would be great for us to have a conversation and recap what we think we heard from all of them. So let&#8217;s just start at the top.&nbsp;



So in this first episode in the second half of this podcast series, we talked to economists Azeem Azhar and Ethan Mollick. And I thought those conversations were really interesting. Maybe there were, kind of, two things, two main topics. One was just the broader impact on the economy, on the cost of healthcare, on overall workforce issues.&nbsp;



One of the things that I thought was really interesting was something that Ethan Mollick brought up. And maybe just to refresh our memories, let&#8217;s play this little clip from Ethan.&nbsp;



ETHAN MOLLICK: So we’re in this really interesting period where there’s incredible amounts of individual innovation in productivity and performance improvements in this field, like very high levels of it. … We’re seeing that in nonmedical problems, the same kind of thing, which is, you know, we’ve got research showing 20 and 40% performance improvements. … But then the organization doesn’t capture it; the system doesn’t capture it. Because the individuals are doing their own work, and the systems don’t have the ability to, kind of, learn or adapt as a result.&nbsp;



LEE: So let me start with you, Zak. Does that make sense to you? Are you seeing something similar?&nbsp;



KOHANE: I thought it was incredibly insightful because we discussed on our earlier podcast how a chief AI officer in one of the healthcare hospitals, in one of the healthcare systems, was highly regulating the use of AI, but yet in her own practice on her smartphone was using all these AI technologies.&nbsp;



And so it&#8217;s insightful that on the one hand, she is increasing her personal productivity, …&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … and perhaps she&#8217;s increasing her quality of her care. But it&#8217;s very hard for the healthcare system to actually realize any gains. It&#8217;s unlikely … let&#8217;s put it this way. It would be for her a defeat if they said, “Now you should see more patients.”&nbsp;



LEE: Yes. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



KOHANE: Now, I&#8217;m not saying that won&#8217;t happen. It could happen. But, you know, gains of productivity are really at the individual level of the doctors. And that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re adopting it. That&#8217;s why the ambient dictation tools are so successful. But really turning it into things that matter in terms of productivity for healthcare, namely making sure that patients are getting healthy, requires that every piece of the puzzle works well together. You know, it&#8217;s well-tread ground to talk about how patients get very expensive procedures, like a cardiac transplant, and then go home, and they’re not put on blood thinners …&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … and then they get a stroke. You know, the chain is as strong as the weakest link. And just having AI in one part of it is not going to do it. And so hospitals, I think, are doubly burdened by the fact that, (A) they tend to not like innovation because they are high-revenue, low-margin companies. But if they want it implemented effectively, they have to do it across the entire processes of healthcare, which are vast and not completely under their control.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Yep. You know, that was Sara Murray, who&#8217;s the chief health AI officer at UC San Francisco.&nbsp;



And then, you know, Carey, remember, we were puzzled by Chris Longhurst&#8217;s finding in a controlled study that the, you know, having an AI respond to patient emails didn&#8217;t seem to lead to any, I guess you would call it, productivity benefits. I remember we were both kind of puzzled by that. I wonder if that&#8217;s related to what Ethan is saying here.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: I mean, possibly, but I think we&#8217;ve seen since then that there have been multiple studies showing that in fact using AI can be extremely effective or helpful, even, for example, for diagnosis.&nbsp;



And so I find just from the patient point of view, it kind of drives me crazy that you have individual physicians using AI because they know that it will improve the care that they&#8217;re offering. And yet you don&#8217;t have their institutions kind of stepping up and saying, “OK, these are the new norms.”&nbsp;



By the way, Ethan Mollick is a national treasure, right. Like, he is the classic example of someone who just stepped up at this moment …&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: … when we saw this extraordinary technological advance. And he&#8217;s not only stepping up for himself. He&#8217;s spreading the word to the masses that this is what these things can do.&nbsp;



And so it&#8217;s frustrating to see the institutions not stepping up and instead the individual doctors having to do it.&nbsp;



KOHANE: But he made another very interesting point, which was that the reason that he could be so informative to not only the public but practitioners of AI is these things would emerge out of the shop, and they would not be aged too long, like a fine wine, before they were just released to the public.&nbsp;



And so he was getting exposure to these models just weeks after some of the progenitors had first seen it. And therefore, because he&#8217;s actually a really creative person in terms of how he exercises models, he sees uses and problems very early on. But the point is institutions, think about how much they are disadvantaged. They&#8217;re not Ethan Mollick. They&#8217;re not the progenitors. So they&#8217;re even further behind. So it&#8217;s very hard. If you talk to most of the C-suite of hospitals, they&#8217;d be delighted to know as much about the impact as Ethan Mollick.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. By the way, you know, I picked out this quote because within Microsoft, and I suspect every other software company, we&#8217;re seeing something very similar, where individual programmers are 20 to 30% more productive just in the number of lines of code they write per day or the number of pull requests per week. Any way you measure it, it&#8217;s very consistent. And yet by the time you get to, say, a 25-person software engineering team, the productivity of that whole team isn&#8217;t 25% more productive.&nbsp;



Now, that is starting to change because we&#8217;re starting to figure out that, well, maybe we should reshape how the team operates. And there&#8217;s more of an orientation towards having, you know, smaller teams of full-stack developers. And then you start to see the gains. But if you just keep the team organized in the usual way, there seems to be a loss. So there&#8217;s something about what Ethan was saying that resonated very strongly with me.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: But I would argue that it&#8217;s not just productivity we&#8217;re talking about. There&#8217;s a moral imperative to improve the care. And if you have tools that will do that, you should be using them or trying harder to.&nbsp;



LEE: Right. Yep.&nbsp;



KOHANE: I think, yes, first of all, absolutely you would. Unfortunately, most of the short-term productivity measures will not measure improvements in the quality of care because it takes a long time to die even with bad care.&nbsp;



And so that doesn&#8217;t show up right away. But I think what Peter just said actually came across in several of the podcasts, which is that it&#8217;s very tricky trying to shoehorn these things into making what we&#8217;re already doing more productive.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. Existing structures.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Yeah. And I know, Carey, that you&#8217;ve raised this issue many times. But it really calls into question, what should we be doing with our time with doctors? And they are a scarce resource. And what is the most efficient way to use them?&nbsp;



You know, I remember we [The New England Journal of Medicine AI] published a paper of someone who was able to use AI to increase the throughput of their emergency room (opens in new tab) by actually more appropriately having the truly sick people in the sick queue, in the triage queue, for urgent care.&nbsp;



And so I think we&#8217;re going to have to think that way more broadly, about we don&#8217;t have to now look at every patient as an unknown with maybe a few pointers on diagnosis. We can have a fairly extensive profiling.&nbsp;



And I know that colleagues in Clalit [Health Services] in Israel, for example, are using the overall trajectory of the patient and some considerations about utilities to actually figure out who to see next week.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, you know, what you said brings up another maybe connection to one thing that we see also in software development. And it relates to also what we were discussing earlier: about the last thing a doctor wants is to have a tool that allows them to see even yet more patients per day.&nbsp;



So in software development, there&#8217;s always this tension. Like, how many lines of code can you write per day? That&#8217;s one productivity measure.&nbsp;



But sometimes we&#8217;re taught, well, don&#8217;t write more lines of code per day, but make sure that your code is well structured. Take the time to document it. Make sure it&#8217;s fully commented. Take the time to talk to your fellow software engineering team members to make sure that it&#8217;s well coordinated. And in the long run, even if you&#8217;re writing half the number of lines of code per day, the software process will be far more efficient.



And so I&#8217;ve wondered whether there&#8217;s a similar thing where doctors could see 20% fewer patients in a day, but if they take the time and also had AI help to coordinate, maybe a patient&#8217;s journey might be half as long. And therefore, the health system would be able to see twice as many patients in a year&#8217;s period or something like that.&nbsp;



KOHANE: So I think you&#8217;ve “nerd sniped” me because you [LAUGHTER]—which is all too easy—but I think there&#8217;s a central issue here. And I think this is the stumbling block between what Ethan&#8217;s telling us about between the individual productivity and the larger productivity, is the team&#8217;s productivity.&nbsp;



And there is actually a good analogy in computer science and that&#8217;s, uh, Brooks’s “mythical man-month,” &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes, exactly.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … where he shows how you can have more and more resources, but when the coordination starts failing, because you have so many, uh, individuals on the team, you start falling apart. And so even if the, uh, individual doctors get that much better, yeah, they take better care of patients, make less stupid things.&nbsp;



But in terms of giving the “I get you into the emergency room, and I get you out of a hospital as fast as possible, as safely as possible, as effectively as possible,” that&#8217;s teamwork. And we don&#8217;t do it. And we&#8217;re not really optimizing our tools for that.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: And just to throw in a little reality check, I&#8217;m not aware of any indication yet that AI is in any way shortening medical journeys or making physicians more efficient. Yet …&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: … at least. Yeah.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes. So I think, you know, with respect to our book, critiquing our book, you know, I think it&#8217;s fair to say we were fairly focused or maybe even fixated on the individual doctor or nurse or patient, and we didn&#8217;t really, at least I never had a time where I stepped back to think about the whole care coordination team or the whole health system.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And I think that&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s because, first of all, you weren’t thinking about it? It&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re taught in medical school. We&#8217;re not taught to talk about team communication excellence. And I think it&#8217;s absolutely essential.&nbsp;



There’s a … what’s the … there was an early … [Terry] Winograd. And he was trying to capture what are the different kinds of actions related to pronouncements that you could expect and how could AI use that. And that was beginning to get at it.&nbsp;



But I actually think this is dark matter of human organizational technology that is not well understood. And our products don&#8217;t do well. You know, we can talk about all the groupware things that are out there. But they all don&#8217;t quite get to that thing.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And I can imagine an AI serving as a team leader, a really active team leader, a real quarterback of, let&#8217;s say, a care team.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, in fact, you know, we have been trying to experiment with this. My colleague, Matt Lungren, who was also one of the interviewees early on, has been working with Stanford Medicine on a tumor board AI agent—something that would facilitate tumor board meetings.&nbsp;



And the early experiences are pretty interesting. Whether it relates to efficiency or productivity I think remains to be seen, but it does seem pretty interesting.&nbsp;



But let&#8217;s move on.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Well, actually, Peter, …&nbsp;



LEE: Oh, go ahead.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: … if you&#8217;re willing to not quite move on yet …&nbsp;



LEE: [LAUGHS] All right.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: … this kind of segues into one of, I think, the most provocative questions that arose in the course of these episodes and that I&#8217;d love to have you answer, which was, remember, it was a question at a gathering that you were at, and you were asked, “Well, you&#8217;re focusing a lot on potential AI effects on individual patient and physician experiences. But what about the revolution, right? What about, like, can you be more big-picture and envision how generative AI could actually, kind of, overturn or fix the broken system, right?”&nbsp;



I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve thought about that a lot. Like, what&#8217;s your answer?&nbsp;



LEE: You know, I think ultimately, it will have to. For it to really make a difference, I think that the normal processes, our normal concept of how healthcare is delivered—how new medical discoveries are made and brought into practice—I think those things are going to have to change a lot.&nbsp;



You know, one of the things I think about a lot right at the moment is, you know, we tend to think about, let&#8217;s say, medical diagnosis as a problem-solving exercise. And I think, at least at the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine, the instruction really treats it as a kind of detective thing based on a lot of knowledge about biology and biomedicine and human condition, and so on.&nbsp;



But there&#8217;s another way to think about it, given AI, which is when you see a patient and you develop some data, maybe through a physical exam, labs, and so on, you can just simply ask, “You know, what did the 500 other people who are most similar to this experience, how were they diagnosed? How were they treated? What were their outcomes? What were their experiences?”&nbsp;



And that&#8217;s really a fundamentally different paradigm. And it just seems like at least the technical means will be there. And by the way, that also then relates to [the questions]: “And what was most efficacious cost-wise? What was most efficient in terms of the total length of the patient journey? How does this relate to my quality scores so I can get more money from Medicare and Medicaid?”&nbsp;



All of those things, I think, you know, we&#8217;re starting to confront.&nbsp;



One of the other episodes that we&#8217;re going to talk about, was my interview with two medical students. Actually, thinking of a Morgan Cheatham as just a medical student or medical resident [LAUGHTER] is a little strange. But he is.&nbsp;



One of the things he talks about is the importance that he placed in his medical training about adopting AI. So, Zak, I assume you see this also with some students at Harvard Medical School. And the other medical student we interviewed, Daniel Chen, seemed to indicate this, too, where it seems like it&#8217;s the students who are bringing AI into the medical education ahead of the faculty. Does that resonate with you?&nbsp;



KOHANE: It absolutely resonates with me. There are students I run into who, honestly, my first thought when I&#8217;m talking to them is, why am I teaching you [LAUGHTER], and why are you not starting a big AI company, AI medicine company, now and really change healthcare instead of going through the rest of the rigmarole? And I think broadly, higher education has a problem there, which is we have not embraced, again, going back to Ethan, a lot of the tools that can be used. And it&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t know necessarily the right way to teach them. And so far, the only lasting heuristic seems to be: use them and use them often.&nbsp;



And so it&#8217;s an awkward thing, where the person who knows how to use the AI tools now in the first-year medical school can teach themselves better and faster than anybody else in their class who is just relying on the medical school curriculum.&nbsp;



LEE: Now, the reason I brought up Morgan now after our discussion with Ethan Mollick is Morgan also talked about AI collapsing medical specialties.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yes.&nbsp;



LEE: And so let&#8217;s hear this snippet from him.&nbsp;



MORGAN CHEATHAM: AI collapses medical specialties onto themselves, right. You have the canonical example of the cardiologist, you know, arguing that we should diuresis and maybe the nephrologist arguing that we should, you know, protect the kidneys. And how do two disciplines disagree on what is right for the patient when in theory, there is an objective best answer given that patient’s clinical status? … So I’m interested in this question of whether medical specialties themselves need to evolve. And if we look back in the history of medical technology, there are many times where a new technology forced a medical specialty to evolve.



LEE: So on the specific question about specialties, Zak, do you have a point of view? And let me admit, first of all, for us, all three of us, we didn&#8217;t have any clue about this in our book. I don&#8217;t think.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Not much. Not much of a clue.&nbsp;



So I&#8217;m reminded of a New Yorker cartoon where you see a bunch of surgeons around the patient, and someone says, “Is that a spleen?” And it says, “I don&#8217;t know. I slept during the spleen lecture,” [LAUGHTER] and &#8230; or “I didn&#8217;t take the spleen course.”&nbsp;



And yet when we measure things, we measure things much more than we think we are doing. So for example, we [NEJM AI] just published a paper where echocardiograms were being done. And it turns out those ultrasound waves just happen to also permeate the liver. And you can actually diagnose on the way with AI all the liver disease (opens in new tab) that is in—and treatable liver disease—that&#8217;s in those patients.&nbsp;



But if you&#8217;re a cardiologist, “Liver? You know, I slept through liver lecture.” [LAUGHTER] And so I do think that, (A) the natural, often guild/dollar-driven silos in medicine are less obvious to AI, despite the fact that they do exist in departments and often in chapters.&nbsp;



But Morgan&#8217;s absolutely right. I can tell you as an endocrinologist, if I have a child in the ICU, the endocrinologist, the nephrologist, and the neurosurgeon will argue about the right thing to do.&nbsp;



And so in my mind, the truly revolutionary thing to do is to go back to 1994 with Pete Szolovits, the Guardian Angel Project (opens in new tab). What I think you need is a process. And the process is the quarterback. And the quarterback has only one job: take care of the patient.&nbsp;



And it should be thinking all the time about the patient. What&#8217;s the right thing? And can be as school-marmish or not about, “Zak, you&#8217;re eating this or that or exercise or sleep,” but also, “Hey, surgeons and endocrinologists, you&#8217;re talking about my host, Zak. This is the right way because this problem and this problem and our best evidence is this is the right way to get rid of the fluid. The other ways will kill him.”



And I think you need an authoritative quarterback that has the view of the others but then makes the calls.&nbsp;



LEE: Is that quarterback going to be AI or human?&nbsp;



KOHANE: Well, for the very lucky people, it&#8217;ll be a human augmented by AI, super concierge.&nbsp;



But I think we&#8217;re running out of doctors. And so realistically, it&#8217;s going to be an AI that will have to be certified in very different ways, along the ways Dave Blumenthal says, essentially, trial by fire. Like putting residents into clinics, we&#8217;re going to be putting AIs into clinics.&nbsp;



But what&#8217;s worse, by the way, than the three doctors arguing about care in front of the patient is, what happens so frequently, is then you see them outpatient, and each one of them gives you a different set of decisions to make. Sometimes that actually interact pathologically, unhealthily with each other. And only the very smart nurses or primary care physicians will actually notice that and call, quote, a “family meeting,” or bring everybody in the same room to align them.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, I think this idea of quarterback is really very, very topical right now because there&#8217;s so much intensity in the AI space around agents. And in fact, you know, the Microsoft AI team under Mustafa Suleyman and Dominic King, Harsha Nori, and team just recently posted a paper on something called sequential diagnosis, which is basically an AI quarterback that is supposed to smartly consult with other AI specialties. And interestingly, one of the AI agents is sort of the devil&#8217;s advocate that&#8217;s always criticizing and questioning things. 



GOLDBERG: That’s interesting.&nbsp;



LEE: And at least on very, very hard, rare cases, it can develop some impressive results. There&#8217;s something to this that I think is emerging.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: And, Peter, Morgan said something that blew me away even more, which was, well, why do we even need specialists if the reason for a specialist is because there&#8217;s so much medical knowledge that no single physician can know all of it, and therefore we create specialists, but that limitation does not exist for AI.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Yeah.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: And so there he was kind of undermining this whole elaborate structure that has grown up because of human limitations that may not ultimately need to be there.&nbsp;



LEE: Right. So now that gives me a good segue to get back to our economist and get to something that Azeem Azhar said. And so there&#8217;s a clip here from Azeem.&nbsp;



AZEEM AZHAR: We didn’t talk about, you know, AI in its ability to potentially do this, which is to extend the clinician’s presence throughout the week. You know, the idea that maybe some part of what the clinician would do if you could talk to them on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday could be delivered through an app or a chatbot just as a way of encouraging the compliance, which is often, especially with older patients, one reason why conditions, you know, linger on for longer.&nbsp;



LEE: And, you know, in the same conversation, he also talked about his own management of asthma and the fact that he&#8217;s been managing this for several decades and knows more than any other human being, no matter how well medically trained, could possibly know. And it&#8217;s also very highly personalized. And it&#8217;s not a big leap to imagine AI having that sort of lifelong understanding.&nbsp;



KOHANE: So in fact, I want to give credit back to our book since you insulted us. [LAUGHTER] You challenged us. You doubted us. We do have at the end of the book a AI which is helping this woman manage her way through life. It&#8217;s quarterbacking for the woman all these different services.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



KOHANE: So there.&nbsp;



LEE: Ah, you&#8217;re right. Yes. In fact, it&#8217;s very much, I think, along the lines of the vision that Azeem laid out in our conversation.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. It also reminded me of the piece Zak wrote about his mother (opens in new tab) at one point when she was managing congestive heart failure and she needed to watch her weight very carefully to see her fluid status. And absolutely, there&#8217;s no … I see no reason whatsoever why that couldn&#8217;t be done with AI right now. Actually, although back then, Zak, you were writing that it takes much more than an AI [LAUGHS] to manage such a thing, right?&nbsp;



KOHANE: You need an AI that you can trust. Now, my mother was born in 1927, and she&#8217;d learned through the school of hard knocks that you can&#8217;t trust too many people, maybe even not your son, MD, PhD [LAUGHTER].&nbsp;



But what I&#8217;ve been surprised [by] is how, for example, how many people are willing to trust and actually see effective use of AI as mental health counselors, for example.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah&nbsp;



KOHANE: So it may in fact be that there&#8217;s a generational thing going on, and at least there&#8217;ll be some very large subset of patients which will be completely comfortable in ways that my mother would have never tolerated.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Now, I think we&#8217;re starting to veer into some of the core AI.&nbsp;



And so I think maybe one of the most fun conversations I had was in the episode with both Sébastien Bubeck, my former colleague at Microsoft Research, and now he&#8217;s at OpenAI, and Bill Gates. And there was so much that was, I thought, interesting there. And there was one point, I think that sort of touches tangentially on what we were just conversing about, that Sébastien said. So let&#8217;s hear this snippet.&nbsp;



SÉBASTIEN BUBECK: And one example that I really like, a study that recently appeared where … they were comparing doctors without and with ChatGPT. … So this was a set of cases where the accuracy of the doctors alone was around 75%. ChatGPT alone was 90%. … But then the kicker is that doctors with ChatGPT was 80%. Intelligence alone is not enough. It’s also how it’s presented, how you interact with it. And ChatGPT, it’s an amazing tool. Obviously, I absolutely love it. But it’s not … you don’t want a doctor to have to type in, you know, prompts and use it that way. It should be, as Bill was saying, kind of running continuously in the background, sending you notifications.



LEE: So I thought Sébastien was saying something really profound, but I haven&#8217;t been able to quite decide or settle in my mind what it is. What do you make of what Seb just said?&nbsp;



KOHANE: I think it&#8217;s context. I think that it requires an enormous amount of energy, brain energy, to actually correctly provide the context that you want this thing to work on. And it&#8217;s only going to really feel like we&#8217;re in a different playing field when it&#8217;s listening all the time, and it just steps right in.&nbsp;



There is an advantage that, for example, a good programmer can have in prompting Cursor or any of these tools to do so. But it takes effort. And I think being in the conversation all the time so that you understand the context in the widest possible way is incredibly important. And I think that&#8217;s what Seb is getting at, which is if we spoon feed these machines, yes, 90%.&nbsp;



But then, talking to a human being who then has to interact and gets distracted from whatever flow they&#8217;re in and maybe even makes them feel like an early bicycle rider who all of a sudden realizes, “I&#8217;m balancing on two wheels—oh no!” And they fall over. You know, there&#8217;s that interaction which is negatively synergistic.&nbsp;



And so I do think it&#8217;s a very hard human-computer engineering problem. How do we make these two agents, human and computational, work in an ongoing way in the flow? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m seeing anything that&#8217;s particularly new. And the things that you&#8217;re beginning to hint about, Peter, in terms of agentic coordination, I think we&#8217;ll get to some of that. 



LEE: Yeah. Carey, does this give you any pause? The kind of results that … they&#8217;re puzzling results. I mean, the idea of doctors with AI seeming at least in this one test—it&#8217;s just one test—but it&#8217;s odd that it does worse than the AI alone.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yes. I would want to understand more about the actual conditions of that study.&nbsp;



From what Bill Gates said, I was most struck by the question of resource-poor environments. That even though this was absolutely one of the most promising, brightest perspectives that we highlighted in the book, we still don&#8217;t seem to be seeing a lot of use among the one half of humanity that lacks decent access to healthcare.&nbsp;



I mean, there are access problems everywhere, including here in the United States. And it is one of the most potentially promising uses of AI. And I thought if anyone would know about it, he would with the work that the Gates Foundation does.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, I think both you and Bill, I felt, are really simpatico. You know, Bill expressed genuine surprise that more isn&#8217;t happening yet. And it really echoed, in fact, maybe even using some of the exact same words that you&#8217;ve used. And so two years on, you&#8217;ve expressed repeatedly expecting to have seen more out in the field by now. And then I thought Bill was saying something in our conversation very similar.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, for me, I see it both ways. I see the world of medicine really moving fast in confronting the reality of AI in such a serious way. But at the same time, it&#8217;s also hard to escape the feeling that somehow, we should be seeing even more.&nbsp;



So it&#8217;s an odd thing, a little bit paradoxical.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. I think one thing that we didn&#8217;t focus on hardly at all in the book but that we are seeing is these companies rising up, stepping up to the challenge, Abridge and OpenEvidence, and what Morgan describes as a new stack, right.&nbsp;



So there is that on the flip side.&nbsp;



LEE: Now, I want to get back to this thing that Seb was saying. And, you know, I had to bring up the issue of sycophancy, which we discussed at our last roundtable also. But it was particularly … at the time that Seb, Bill, and I had our conversation, OpenAI had just gone through having to retract a fresh update of GPT-4o because it had become too sycophantic.&nbsp;



So I can&#8217;t escape the feeling that some of these human-computer interaction issues are related to this tension between you want AI to follow your directions and be faithful to you, but at the same time not agree with you so often that it becomes a fault.&nbsp;



KOHANE: I think it&#8217;s asking the AI to enter into a fundamental human conundrum, which is there are extreme versions of doublethink, and there&#8217;s everyday things, everyday asks of doublethink, which is how to be an effective citizen.&nbsp;



And even if you&#8217;re thinking, “Hmm. I&#8217;m thinking this. I&#8217;m just not going to say it because that would be rude or counterproductive.” Or some of the official doublethinks, where you&#8217;re actually told you must say this, even if you think something else. And I think we&#8217;re giving a very tough mission for these things: be nice to the user and be useful.&nbsp;



And, in education, where the thing is not always one in the same. Sometimes you have to give a little tough love to educate someone, and doing that well is both an art and it&#8217;s also very difficult. And so, you know, I&#8217;m willing to believe that the latest frontier models that have made the news in the last month are very high-performing, but they&#8217;re also all highlighting that tension …&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … that tension between behaving like a good citizen and being helpful. And this gets back to what are the fundamental values that we hope these things are following.&nbsp;



It&#8217;s not, you know, “Are these things going to develop us into the paperclip factory?” It&#8217;s more of, “Which of our values are going to be elevated, and which one will be suppressed?”&nbsp;



LEE: Well, since I criticized our book before, let me pat ourselves on the back this time because, I think, pervasive throughout our book, we were touching on some of these issues.&nbsp;



In fact, we started the book, you know, with GPT-4 scolding me for wanting it to impersonate Zak. And there was the whole example of asking it to rewrite a poem in a certain way, and it kind of silently just tried to slide, you know, without me knowing, slide by without following through on the whole thing.&nbsp;



And so that early version of GPT-4 was definitely not sycophantic at all. In fact, it was just as prone to call you an idiot if it thought you were wrong. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



KOHANE: I had some very testy conversations around my endocrine diagnosis with it. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. Well then, Peter, I would ask you, I mean last time I asked you about, well, hallucinations, aren&#8217;t those solvable? And this time I would ask you, well, sycophancy, isn&#8217;t that kind of like a dial you can turn? Like, is that not solvable?&nbsp;



LEE: You know, I think there are several interlocking problems. But if we assume superintelligence, even with superintelligence, medicine is such an inexact science that there will always be situations that are guesses that take into account other factors of a person&#8217;s life, other value judgments, exactly as Zak had pointed out in our previous roundtable conversation.&nbsp;



And so I think there&#8217;s always going to be an opening for either differences of opinion or agreeing with you too much. And there are dangers in both cases. And I think they&#8217;ll always be present. I don&#8217;t know that, at least in something as inexact as medical science, I don&#8217;t know that it&#8217;ll ever be completely eliminated.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And it&#8217;s interesting because I was trying to think what&#8217;s the right balance, but there are patients who want to be told this is what you do. Whereas there&#8217;s other patients who want to go through every detail of the reasoning.&nbsp;



And it&#8217;s not a matter of education. It&#8217;s really a temperamental, personality issue. And so we&#8217;re going to have to, I think, develop personalities …&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … that are most effective for those different kinds of individuals. And so I think that is going to be the real frontier. Having human values and behaving in ways that are recognizable and yet effective for certain groups of patients.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And lots of deep questions, including how paternalistic do we want to be?&nbsp;



LEE: All right, so we&#8217;re getting into medical science and hallucination. So that gives me a great segue to the conversations in the episode on biomedical research. And one of the people that I interviewed was Noubar Afeyan from Moderna and Flagship Pioneering. So let&#8217;s listen to this snippet.&nbsp;



NOUBAR AFEYAN: We, some hundred or so times a year, ask “what if” questions that lead us to totally weird places of thought. We then try to iterate, iterate, iterate to come up with something that’s testable. Then we go into a lab, and we test it. So in that world, right, sitting there going, like, “How do I know this transformer is going to work?” The answer is, “For what?” Like, it’s going to work to make something up … well, guess what? We knew early on with LLMs that hallucination was a feature, not a bug for what we wanted to do.



LEE: [LAUGHS] So I think that really touches on just the fact that there&#8217;s so many unknowns and such lack of precision and exactness in our understanding of human biology and of medicine. Carey, what do you think?&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: I mean, I just have this emotional reaction, which is that I love the idea of AI marching into biomedical science and everything from getting to the virtual cell eventually to, Zak, I think it was a colleague of yours who recently published about &#8230; it was a new medication that had been sort of discovered by AI (opens in new tab), and it was actually testing out up to the phase II level or something, right?



KOHANE: Oh, this is Marinka’s work.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah, Marinka, Marinka Zitnik. And … yeah. So, I mean, I think it avoids a lot of the, sort of, dilemmas that are involved with safety and so on with AI coming into medicine. And it&#8217;s just the discovery process, which we all want to advance as quickly as possible. And it seems like it actually has a great deal of potential that&#8217;s already starting to be realized.&nbsp;



LEE: Oh, absolutely.&nbsp;



KOHANE: I love this topic. First of all, I thought, actually, I think Bill and Seb, actually, had interesting things to say on that very topic, rationales which I had not really considered why, in fact, things might progress faster in the discovery space than in the clinical delivery space, just because we don&#8217;t know in clinical medicine what we&#8217;re trying to maximize precisely. Whereas for a drug effect, we do know what we&#8217;re trying to maximize.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, in fact, I happened to save that snippet from Bill Gates saying that. So let&#8217;s cue that up.&nbsp;



BILL GATES: I think it’s very much within the realm of possibility that the AI is not only accelerating healthcare discovery but substituting for a lot of the roles of, you know, “I’m an organic chemist,” or “I run various types of assays.” I can see those, which are, you know, testable-output-type jobs but with still very high value, I can see, you know, some replacement in those areas before the doctor.&nbsp;



LEE: So, Zak, isn&#8217;t that Bill saying exactly what you’re saying?&nbsp;



KOHANE: That is my point. I have to say that this is another great bet, that either we&#8217;re all going to be surprised or a large group of people will be surprised or disappointed.&nbsp;



There&#8217;s still a lot of people in the sort of medicinal chemist, trialist space who are still extremely skeptical that this is going to work. And we haven&#8217;t quite shown them yet that it is. Why have we not shown them? Because we haven&#8217;t gone all the way to a phase III study, which showed that the drug behaves as expected to, is effective, and basically doesn&#8217;t hurt people. That turns out to require a lot of knowledge. I actually think we&#8217;re getting there, but I understand the skepticism.&nbsp;



LEE: Carey, what are your thoughts?&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. I mean, there will be no way around going through full-on clinical trials for anything to ever reach the market. But at the same time, you know, it&#8217;s clearly very promising. And just to throw out something for the pure fun of it, Peter, I saw &#8230; one of my favorite tweets recently was somebody saying, you know, isn&#8217;t it funny how computer science is actually becoming a lot more like biology in that it&#8217;s just becoming empirical.&nbsp;



It&#8217;s like you just throw stuff at the AI and see what it does. [LAUGHTER] And I was like, oh, yeah, that&#8217;s what Peter was doing when we wrote the book. I mean, he understood as many innards as anybody can. But at the same time, it was a totally empirical exercise in seeing what this thing would do when you threw things at it.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: So it&#8217;s the new biology.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, yeah. So I think we talked in our book about accelerating, you know, biomedical knowledge and medical science. And that actually seems to be happening. And I really had fun talking to Daphne Koller about some of the accomplishments that she&#8217;s made. And so here&#8217;s a little snippet from Daphne.&nbsp;



DAPHNE KOLLER: This will impact not only the early stages of which hypotheses we interrogate, which molecules we move forward, but also hopefully at the end of the day, which molecule we prescribe to which patient. And I think there’s been obviously so much narrative over the years about precision medicine, personalized medicine, and very little of that has come to fruition, with the exception of, you know, certain islands in oncology, primarily on genetically driven cancers.&nbsp;



LEE: So, Zak, when I was listening to that, I was reminded of one of the very first examples that you had where, you know, you had a very rare case of a patient, and you&#8217;re having to narrow down some pretty complex and very rare genetic conditions. This thing that Daphne says, that seems to be the logical conclusion that everyone who&#8217;s thinking hard about AI and biology is coming to. Does it seem more real now two years on?&nbsp;



KOHANE: It absolutely seems more real. Here&#8217;s some sad facts. If you are at a cancer center, you will get targeted therapies if you qualify for it. Outside cancer centers, you won&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s not that the therapies aren&#8217;t available. It&#8217;s just that you won&#8217;t have people thinking about it in that way. And especially if you have some of the rare and more aggressive cancers, if you&#8217;re outside one of those cancer centers, you&#8217;re at a significant disadvantage for survival for that reason. And so anything that provides just the “simple,” in quotes, dogged investigation of the targeted therapies for patients, it&#8217;s a home run.&nbsp;



So my late graduate student, Atul Butte, died recently at UCSF, where he was both a professor and the leader of the Bakar Institute, and he was a Zuckerberg Chan Professor of Pediatrics.&nbsp;



He was diagnosed with a rare tumor two years ago. His wife is a PhD biologist, and when he was first diagnosed, she sent me the diagnosis and the mutations. And I don&#8217;t know if you know this, Peter, but this was still when we were writing the book and people didn&#8217;t know about GPT-4.&nbsp;



I put in those mutations into GPT-4 and the diagnosis. And I said, “I&#8217;d like to help treat my friend. What&#8217;s the right treatment?” And GPT, to paraphrase, GPT-4 said, “Before we start talking about treatment, are you sure this is the right diagnosis? Those mutations are not characteristic for that tumor.&#8221; And he had been misdiagnosed. And then they changed the diagnosis therapy and some personnel. 



So I don&#8217;t have to hallucinate this. It&#8217;s already happened, and we&#8217;re going to need this. And so I think targeted therapy for cancers is the most obvious use. And if God forbid one of you has a family member who has cancer, it&#8217;s moral malpractice not to look at the genetics and run it past GPT-4 and say, “What are the available therapies?”&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: I really deeply believe that.&nbsp;



LEE: Carey, I think one thing you&#8217;ve always said is that you&#8217;re surprised that we don&#8217;t hear more stories along these lines. And I think you threw a quote from Mustafa Suleyman back at me. Do you want to share that?&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yes. Recently, I believe it was a Big Technology interview (opens in new tab), and the reporter asked Mustafa Suleyman, “So you guys are seeing 50 million queries, medical queries, a day [to Copilot and Bing]. You know, how&#8217;s that going?” And I think I am a bit surprised that we&#8217;re not seeing more stories of all types. Both here&#8217;s how it helped me and also here was maybe, you know, a suggestion that was not optimal.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. I do think in our book, we did predict both positive and negative outcomes of this. And it is odd. Atul was very open with his story. And of course, he is such … he was such a prominent leader in the world of medicine.&nbsp;



But I think I share your surprise, Carey. I expected by now that a lot more public stories would be out. Maybe there is someone writing a book collecting these things, I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Maybe someone called Carey Goldberg should write that book. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Write a book, maybe. I mean, we have Patients Use AI (opens in new tab), which is a wonderful blog by Dave deBronkart, the patient advocate.&nbsp;



But I wonder if it&#8217;s also something structural, like who would be or what would be the institution that would be gathering these stories? I don’t know.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And that&#8217;s the problem. You see, this goes back to the same problem that [Ethan] Mollick was talking about. Individual doctors are using them. The hospital as a whole is not doing that. So it&#8217;s not judging the quality, as part of its quality metrics, of how good the AI is performing and what new has happened. And the other audience, namely the patients, have no mechanism. There is no mechanism to go to Better Business Bureau and say, “They screwed up,” or “This was great.”&nbsp;



LEE: So now I want to get a little more futuristic. And this gets into whether AI is really going to get almost to the ab initio understanding of human biology. And so Eric Topol, who is one of the guests, spoke to this a bit. So let&#8217;s hear this.&nbsp;



LEE: So you talk about a virtual cell. Is that achievable within 10 years, or is that still too far out?ERIC TOPOL: No, I think within 10 years for sure. You know, the group that got assembled, that Steve Quake pulled together, I think has 42 authors in a paper in Cell. The fact that he could get these 42 experts in life science and some in computer science to come together and all agree that not only is this a worthy goal, but it’s actually going to be realized, that was impressive. 



LEE: You know, I have to say Eric&#8217;s optimism took me aback. Just speaking as a techie, I think I started off being optimistic: as soon as we can figure out molecular dynamics, biology can be solved. And then you start to learn more about biochemistry, about the human cell, and then you realize, oh, my God, this is just so vast and unknowable. And now you have Eric Topol saying, “Well, in less than 10 years.”&nbsp;



KOHANE: So what&#8217;s delightful about this period is that those of us who are cautious were so incredibly wrong about AI two years ago. [LAUGHTER] That&#8217;s a true joy &#8230; I mean, absolute joy. It&#8217;s great to have your futurism made much more positive.&nbsp;



But I think that we&#8217;re going from, you know, for example, AlphaFold has had tremendous impact. But remember, that was built on years of acquisition of crystallography data that was annotated. And of course, the annotation process becomes less relevant as you go down the pipe, but it started from that.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And there&#8217;s lots of parts of the cell. So when people talk about virtual cells—I don&#8217;t mean to get too technical—mostly they&#8217;re talking about perturbation of gene expression. They&#8217;re not talking about, “Oh, this is how the liposome and the centrosome interact, and notice how the Golgi bodies bump into each other.”&nbsp;



There&#8217;s a whole bunch of other levels of abstraction we know nothing about. This is a complex factory. And right now, we&#8217;re sort of the level from code into loading code into memory. We&#8217;re not talking about how the rest of the robots work in that cell, and how the rest of those robots work in the cell turns out to be pretty important to functioning.&nbsp;



So I&#8217;d love to be wrong again. And in 10 years, oh yeah, not only, you know, our first in-human study will be you, Dr. Zak. We&#8217;re going put the drug because we fully simulated you. That&#8217;d be great.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And, by the way, just to give people their due, there probably was a lot of animal research that could be done in silico and that for various political reasons we&#8217;re now seeing happen. That&#8217;s a good thing. But I think that sometimes it takes a lot of hubris to get us where we need to get, but my horizon is not the same as his.&nbsp;



LEE: So I guess I have to take this time to brag. Just recently out of our AI for Science team did publish in Science a biological emulator that does pretty long timespan, very, very precise, and very efficient molecular dynamics, biomolecular dynamics emulation. We call it emulation because it&#8217;s not simulating every single time step but giving you the final confirmations.&nbsp;



KOHANE: That&#8217;s an amazing result.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: But … that is an amazing result. And you&#8217;re doing it in some very important interactions. But there&#8217;s so much more to do.&nbsp;



LEE: I know, and it&#8217;s single molecules; it&#8217;s not even two molecules. There&#8217;s so much more to go for here. But on the other hand, Eric is right, you know, 42 experts writing for Cell, you know, that&#8217;s not a small matter.&nbsp;



KOHANE: So I think sometimes you really need to drink your own hallucinogens to actually succeed. Because remember, when the Human Genome Project (opens in new tab) was launched, we didn&#8217;t know how to sequence at scale.&nbsp;



We said maybe we would get there. And then in order to get the right funding and excitement and, I think, focus, we predicted that by early 2000s we&#8217;d be transforming medicine. Has not happened yet. Things have happened, but at a much slower pace. And we&#8217;re 25 years out. In fact, we&#8217;re 35 years out from the launch.&nbsp;



But again, things are getting faster and faster. Maybe the singularity is going to make a whole bunch of things easier. And GPT-6 will just say, “Zak, you are such a pessimist. Let me show you how it&#8217;s done.”&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah.&nbsp;



It really is a pessimism versus optimism. Like is it, I mean, biology is such a bitch, right. [LAUGHTER] Can we actually get there?&nbsp;



At the same time, everyone was surprised and blown away by the, you know, the quantum leap of GPT-4. Who knows when enough data gets in there if we might not have a similar leap.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. All right.&nbsp;



So let&#8217;s get back to healthcare delivery. Besides Morgan Cheatham, we talked to [a] more junior medical student who&#8217;s at the Kaiser Permanente School of Medicine, Daniel Chen. And, you know, I asked him about this question of patients who come in armed [LAUGHS] with a lot of their own information. Let&#8217;s hear what he said about this.&nbsp;



DANIEL CHEN: But for those that come in with a list, I sometimes sit down with them, and we’ll have a discussion, honestly. … “I don’t think you have meningitis because, you know, you’re not having a fever. Some of the physical exam maneuvers we did were also negative. So I don’t think you have anything to worry about that,” you know. So I think it’s having that very candid conversation with the patient that helps build that initial trust.&nbsp;



LEE: So, Zak, as far as I can tell, Daniel and Morgan are figuring this out on their own as medical students. I don&#8217;t think this is part of the curriculum. Does it need to be?&nbsp;



KOHANE: It&#8217;s missing the bigger point. The incentives and economic forces are such that even if you were Daniel, and things have not changed in terms of incentives, and it&#8217;s 2030, he still has to see this many patients in an hour.&nbsp;



And sitting down, going over that with a patient, let&#8217;s say some might need more &#8230; in fact, I think computer scientists are enriched for these sort of neurotic “explain [to] me why this works,” when often the answer is, “I have no idea; empirically it does.”&nbsp;



And patients in some sense deserve that conversation, and we&#8217;re taught about joint decision making, but in practice, there&#8217;s a lot of skills that are deployed to actually deflect so that you can get through the appointment and see enough patients per hour.&nbsp;



And that&#8217;s why I think that one of the central … another task for AI is how to engage with patients to actually explain to them why their doctor is doing what he&#8217;s doing and perhaps ask the one or two questions that you should be asking the doctor in order to reassure you that they&#8217;re doing the right thing.



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: I just … right now, we are going to have less doctor time, not more doctor time.&nbsp;



And so I&#8217;ve always been struck by the divide between medicine that we&#8217;re taught as it should be practiced as a gentle person&#8217;s vocation or sport as opposed to assembly line, heads down “you&#8217;ve got to see those patients by the end of the day” because, otherwise, you haven&#8217;t seen all the patients at the end of the day.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Carey, I&#8217;ve been dying to ask you this, and I have not asked you this before. When you go see a doctor, are you coming in armed with ChatGPT information?&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: I haven&#8217;t needed to yet, but I certainly would. And also my reaction to the medical student description was, I think we need to distinguish between the last 20 years, when patients would come in armed with Google, and what they&#8217;re coming in with now because at least the experiences that I&#8217;ve witnessed, it is miles better to have gone back and forth with GPT-4 than with, you know, dredging what you can from Google. And so I think we should make that distinction.&nbsp;



And also, the other thing that most interested me was this question for medical students of whether they should not use AI for a while so that they can learn …&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: … how to think and similarly maybe don&#8217;t use the automated scribes for a while so they can learn how to do a note. And at what point should they then start being able to use AI? And I suspect it&#8217;s fairly early on that, in fact, they&#8217;re going be using it so consistently that there&#8217;s not that much they need to learn before they start using the tools.&nbsp;



LEE: These two students were incredibly impressive. And so I have wondered, you know, if we got a skewed view of things. I mean, Morgan is, of course, a very, very impressive person. And Daniel was handpicked by the dean of the medical school to be a subject of this interview.&nbsp;



KOHANE: You know, we filter our students, by and large, I mean, there&#8217;s exceptions, but students in medical school are so starry eyed. And they are really &#8230; they got into medical school—I mean, some of them may have faked it—but a lot of them because they really wanted to do good.&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And they really wanted to help. And so this is very constant with them. And it&#8217;s only when they&#8217;re in the machine, past medical school, that they realize, oh my God, this is a very, very different story.&nbsp;



And I can tell you, because I teach a course in computational-enabled medicine, so I get a lot of these nerd medical students, and I&#8217;m telling them, “You&#8217;re going to experience this. And you&#8217;re going to say, ‘I&#8217;m not going to able to change medicine until I get enough cred 10, 15 years from now, whereas I could start my own company and immediately change medicine.’”&nbsp;



And increasingly I&#8217;m getting calls in like residency and saying, “Zak, help me. How do I get out of this?”&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Wow.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And so I think there&#8217;s a real disillusionment of, like, between what we&#8217;re asking for people coming to medical school—we&#8217;re looking for a phenotype—and then we&#8217;re disappointing them massively, not everywhere, but massively.&nbsp;



And for me, it&#8217;s very sad because among our best and brightest, and then because of economics and expectations and the nature of the beast, they&#8217;re not getting to enjoy the most precious part of being a doctor, which is that real human connection, and longitudinality, you know, the connection between the same doctor visit after visit, is more and more of a luxury.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, maybe this gets us to the last episode, you know, where I talk to a former, you know, state director of public health, Umair Shah, and with Gianrico Farrugia, who&#8217;s the CEO of Mayo Clinic. And I think if there&#8217;s one theme that I took away from those conversations is that we&#8217;re not thinking broadly enough nor big enough.&nbsp;



And so here&#8217;s a little quote of exchange that Umair Shah, who was the former head of public health in the State of Washington and prior to that in Harris County, Texas, and we had a conversation about what techies tend to focus on when they&#8217;re thinking about AI and medicine.&nbsp;



UMAIR SHAH: I think one of the real challenges is that when even tech companies, and you can name all of them, when they look at what they&#8217;re doing in the AI space, they gravitate towards healthcare delivery.LEE: Yes. And in fact, it&#8217;s not even delivery. I think techies—I did this, too—tend to gravitate specifically to diagnosis.



LEE: I have been definitely guilty. I think Umair, of course, was speaking as a former frustrated public health official in just thinking about all the other things that are important to maintain a healthy population.&nbsp;



Is there some lesson that we should take away? I think our book also focused a lot on things like diagnosis.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Yeah. Well, first of all, I think we just have to have humility. And I think it&#8217;s a really important ingredient. I found myself staring at the increase in lifespan in human beings over the last two centuries and looking for bumps that were attributable.&nbsp;



I&#8217;m in medical school. I&#8217;ve already made this major commitment. What are the bumps that are attributable to medicine? And there was one bump that was due to vaccines, a small bump. Another small bump that was due to antibiotics. And the rest of it is nutrition, sanitation, yeah, nutrition and sanitation.&nbsp;



And so I think doctors can be incredibly valuable, but not all the time. And we&#8217;re spending now one-sixth of our GDP on it. The majority of it is not effectively prolonging life. And so the humility has to be the right medicine at the right time.&nbsp;



But that runs, (A) against a bunch of business models. It runs against the primacy of doctors in healthcare. It was one thing when there were no textbooks; there was no PubMed. You know, the doctor was the repository of all the probably knowledge that we have. But I think your guests were right. We have to think more broadly in the public health way. How do we make knowledge pervasive like sanitation?&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Although I would add that since what we&#8217;re talking about is AI, it&#8217;s harder to see if &#8230; and if what you&#8217;re talking about is public health, I mean, it was certainly very important to have good data during the pandemic, for example.&nbsp;



But most of the ways to improve public health, like getting people to stop smoking and eat better and sleep better and exercise more, are not things that AI can help with that much. Whereas diagnosis or trying to improve treatment are places that it could tackle.&nbsp;



And in fact, Peter, I wanted to put you—oh, wait, Zak&#8217;s going to say something—but, Peter, I wanted to put you on the spot.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: I mean, if you had a medical issue now, and you went to a physician, would you be OK with them not using generative AI?&nbsp;



LEE: I think if it&#8217;s a complex or a mysterious case, I would want them to use generative AI. I would want that second opinion on things. And I would personally be using it. If for no other reason than just to understand what the chart is saying.&nbsp;



I don&#8217;t see, you know, how or why one wouldn&#8217;t do that now.&nbsp;



KOHANE: It&#8217;s such a cheap second opinion, and people are making mistakes. And even if there are mistakes on the part of AI, if there&#8217;s a collision, discrepancy, that&#8217;s worth having a discussion. And again, this is something that we used to do more of when we had more time with the patients; we&#8217;d have clinic conferences.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



KOHANE: And we don&#8217;t have that now. So I do think that there is a role for AI. But I think again, it&#8217;s much more of a continual presence, being part of a continued conversation rather than an oracle.&nbsp;



And I think that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ll start seeing, when the AI is truly a colleague, and saying, “You know, Zak, that&#8217;s the second time you made that mistake. You know, that&#8217;s not obesity. That&#8217;s the effect of your drugs that you&#8217;re giving her. You better back off of it.” And that&#8217;s what we need to see happen.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, and for the business of healthcare, that also relates directly to quality scores, which translates into money for healthcare providers.&nbsp;



So the last person that we interviewed was Gianrico Farrugia. And, you know, I was sort of wondering, I was expecting to get a story from a CEO saying, “Oh, my God, this has been so disruptive, incredibly important, meaningful, but wow, what a headache.”&nbsp;



At least Gianrico didn&#8217;t expose any of that. Here&#8217;s one of the snippets to give you a sense.&nbsp;



GIANRICO FARRUGIA: When generative AI came, for us, it&#8217;s like, I wouldn&#8217;t say we told you so, but it&#8217;s like, ah, there you go. Here&#8217;s another tool. This is what we&#8217;ve been talking about. Now we can do it even better. Now we can move even faster. Now we can do more for our patients. It truly never was disruptive. It truly immediately became enabling, which is strange, right, because something as disruptive as that instantly became enabling at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;



LEE: So I tried pretty hard in that interview to get Gianrico to admit that there was a period of headache and disruption here. And he never, ever gave me that. And so I take him at his word.&nbsp;



Zak, maybe I should ask you, what about Harvard and the whole Harvard medical ecosystem?&nbsp;



KOHANE: I would be surprised if there are system-wide measurable gains in health quality right now from AI. And I do have to say that Mayo is one of the most marvelous organizations in terms of team behavior. So if there&#8217;s someone who&#8217;s gotten the team part of it right, they&#8217;ve come the closest, which relates to our prior conversation. They have the quarterback idea …&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



KOHANE: … pretty well down compared to others.&nbsp;



Nonetheless, I take him at his word, that it hasn&#8217;t disrupted them. But I&#8217;m also, I have yet to see the evidence that there&#8217;s been a quantum leap in quality or efficacy. And I do believe that it&#8217;s possible to have a quantum leap in efficacy in the right system.&nbsp;



So if they haven&#8217;t been disrupted, I would venture that they&#8217;ve absorbed it, but they haven&#8217;t used it to its fullest potential. And the way I could be proven wrong is next year, also the metrics showing that over the last year, they&#8217;ve had, you know, decreased readmissions, decreased complications, decreased errors and all that. And if so, God bless them. And we should all be more like Mayo.&nbsp;



LEE: So I thought a little bit about two other quotes from the interviews that sort of maybe would send us off with some more inspirational kind of view of the future. And so there&#8217;s one from Bill Gates and one from Gianrico Farrugia. So what I&#8217;d like to do is to play both of those and then maybe we can have our last comments.&nbsp;



BILL GATES: You know, I’ve gone so far as to tell politicians with national health systems that if they deploy AI appropriately, that the quality of care, the overload of the doctors, the improvement in the economics will be enough that their voters will be stunned because they just don’t expect this, and, you know, they could be reelected just on this one thing of fixing what is a very overloaded and economically challenged health system in these rich countries.&nbsp;



And now Gianrico.&nbsp;



GIANRICO FARRUGIA: And we seemed to be on a linear path, which is, let&#8217;s try and reduce administrative burden. Let&#8217;s try and truly be a companion to a physician or other provider. … And then in the next step, we keep going until we get to, now we can call it agentic AI, whatever we want to talk about. And my view was, no, is that let&#8217;s start with that aim, the last aim … because the others will come automatically if you&#8217;re working on that harder problem. Because one, to get to that harder problem, you&#8217;ll find all the other solutions.&nbsp;



All right. I think these are both kind of calls to be more assertive about this and more forward leaning. I think two years into the GPT-4 era, those are pretty significant and pretty optimistic calls to action. So maybe just to give you both one last word. What would be one hope that you would have for the world of healthcare and medicine two years from now?&nbsp;



KOHANE: I would hope for businesses that whoever actually owns them at some holding company level, regardless of who owns them, are truly patient-focused companies, companies where the whole AI is about improving your care, and it&#8217;s only trying to maximize your care and it doesn&#8217;t care about resource limitations.&nbsp;



And as I was listening to Bill, and the problem with what he was saying about saving dollars for governments is for many things, we have some very expensive things that work. And if the AI says, “This is the best thing,” it&#8217;s going to break your bank. And instead, because of research limitations, we play a human-based fancy footwork to get out of it.&nbsp;



That&#8217;s a hard game to play, and I leave it to the politicians and the public health officials who have to do those trades of utilities.&nbsp;



In my role as doctor and patient, I&#8217;d like to see very informed, authoritative agents acting only on our behalf so that when we go and we seek to have our maladies addressed, the only issue is, what&#8217;s the best and right thing for me now? And I think that is both technically realizable. And even in our weird system, there are business plans that will work that can achieve that. That&#8217;s my hope for two years from now.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, fantastic. Carey.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah. I second that so enthusiastically. And I think, you know, we have this very glass half full/glass half empty phenomenon two years after the book came out.&nbsp;



And it&#8217;s certainly very nice to see, you know, new approaches to administrative complexity and to prior authorization and all kinds of ways to make physicians&#8217; lives easier. But really what we all care about is our own health and that we would like to be able to optimize the use of this truly glorious technological achievement to be able to live longer and better lives. And I think what Zak just described is the most logical way to do that.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, I think for me, two years from now, I would like to see all of this digital data that&#8217;s been so painful, such a burden on every doctor and nurse to record, actually amount to something meaningful in the care of patients. And I think it&#8217;s possible.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Amen.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Yeah.&nbsp;



LEE: All right, so it&#8217;s been quite a journey. We were joking before we&#8217;re still on speaking terms after having written a book. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



And then, um, I think listeners might enjoy knowing that we debated amongst ourselves what to do about a second edition, which seemed too painful to me, and so I suggested the podcast, which seemed too painful to the two of you [LAUGHTER]. And in the end, I don&#8217;t know what would have been easier, writing a book or doing this podcast series, but I do think that we learned a lot.&nbsp;



Now, last bit of business here. To avoid having the three of us try to write a book again and do this podcast, I leaned on the production team in Microsoft Research and the Microsoft Research Podcast. And I thought it would be good to give an explicit acknowledgment to all the people who&#8217;ve contributed to this.&nbsp;



So it&#8217;s a long list of names. I&#8217;m going to read through them all. And then I suggest that we all give an applaud [LAUGHTER] to them. And so here we go.&nbsp;



There’s Neeltje Berger, Tetiana Bukhinska, David Celis Garcia, Matt Corwine, Jeremy Crawford, Kristina Dodge, Chris Duryee, Ben Ericson, Kate Forster, Katy Halliday, Alyssa Hughes, Jake Knapp, Weishung Liu, Matt McGinley, Jeremy Mashburn, Amanda Melfi, Wil Morrill, Joe Plummer, Brenda Potts, Lindsay Shanahan, Sarah Sobolewski, David Sullivan,&nbsp;Stephen Sullivan, Amber Tingle, Caitlyn Treanor, Craig Tuschhoff, Sarah Wang, and Katie Zoller.&nbsp;



Really a great team effort, and they made it super easy for us.&nbsp;



GOLDBERG: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.&nbsp;



KOHANE: Thank you. Thank you.



GOLDBERG: Thank you.&nbsp;



[THEME MUSIC]&nbsp;



LEE: A big thank you again to all of our guests for the work they do and the time and expertise they shared with us.&nbsp;



And, last but not least, to our listeners, thank you for joining us. We hope you enjoyed it and learned as much as we did. If you want to go back and catch up on any episodes you may have missed or to listen to any again, you can visit aka.ms/AIrevolutionPodcast (opens in new tab).

• Enhance Geospatial Analysis and GIS Workflows with Amazon Bedrock Capabilities
  As data becomes more abundant and information systems grow in complexity, stakeholders need solutions that reveal quality insights. Applying emerging technologies to the geospatial domain offers a unique opportunity to create transformative user experiences and intuitive workstreams for users and organizations to deliver on their missions and responsibilities. 
In this post, we explore how you can integrate existing systems with Amazon Bedrock to create new workflows to unlock efficiencies insights. This integration can benefit technical, nontechnical, and leadership roles alike. 
Introduction to geospatial data 
Geospatial data is associated with a position relative to Earth (latitude, longitude, altitude). Numerical and structured geospatial data formats can be categorized as follows: 
 
 Vector data – Geographical features, such as roads, buildings, or city boundaries, represented as points, lines, or polygons 
 Raster data – Geographical information, such as satellite imagery, temperature, or elevation maps, represented as a grid of cells 
 Tabular data – Location-based data, such as descriptions and metrics (average rainfall, population, ownership), represented in a table of rows and columns 
 
Geospatial data sources might also contain natural language text elements for unstructured attributes and metadata for categorizing and describing the record in question. Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) provide a way to store, analyze, and display geospatial information. In GIS applications, this information is frequently presented with a map to visualize streets, buildings, and vegetation. 
LLMs and Amazon Bedrock 
Large language models (LLMs) are a subset of foundation models (FMs) that can transform input (usually text or image, depending on model modality) into outputs (generally text) through a process called generation. Amazon Bedrock is a comprehensive, secure, and flexible service for building generative AI applications and agents. 
LLMs work in many generalized tasks involving natural language. Some common LLM use cases include: 
 
 Summarization – Use a model to summarize text or a document. 
 Q&amp;A – Use a model to answer questions about data or facts from context provided during training or inference using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). 
 Reasoning – Use a model to provide chain of thought reasoning to assist a human with decision-making and hypothesis evaluation. 
 Data generation – Use a model to generate synthetic data for testing simulations or hypothetical scenarios. 
 Content generation – Use a model to draft a report from insights derived from an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base or a user’s prompt. 
 AI agent and tool orchestration – Use a model to plan the invocation of other systems and processes. After other systems are invoked by an agent, the agent’s output can then be used as context for further LLM generation. 
 
GIS can implement these capabilities to create value and improve user experiences. Benefits can include: 
 
 Live decision-making – Taking real-time insights to support immediate decision-making, such as emergency response coordination and traffic management 
 Research and analysis – In-depth analysis that humans or systems can identify, such as trend analysis, patterns and relationships, and environmental monitoring 
 Planning – Using research and analysis for informed long-term decision-making, such as infrastructure development, resource allocation, and environmental regulation 
 
Augmenting GIS and workflows with LLM capabilities leads to simpler analysis and exploration of data, discovery of new insights, and improved decision-making. Amazon Bedrock provides a way to host and invoke models as well as integrate the AI models with surrounding infrastructure, which we elaborate on in this post. 
Combining GIS and AI through RAG and agentic workflows 
LLMs are trained with large amounts of generalized information to discover patterns in how language is produced. To improve the performance of LLMs for specific use cases, approaches such as RAG and agentic workflows have been created. Retrieving policies and general knowledge for geospatial use cases can be accomplished with RAG, whereas calculating and analyzing GIS data would require an agentic workflow. In this section, we expand upon both RAG and agentic workflows in the context of geospatial use cases. 
Retrieval Augmented Generation 
With RAG, you can dynamically inject contextual information from a knowledge base during model invocation. 
RAG supplements a user-provided prompt with data sourced from a knowledge base (collection of documents). Amazon Bedrock offers managed knowledge bases to data sources, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and SharePoint, so you can provide supplemental information, such as city development plans, intelligence reports, or policies and regulations, when your AI assistant is generating a response for a user. 
Knowledge bases are ideal for unstructured documents with information stored in natural language. When your AI model responds to a user with information sourced from RAG, it can provide references and citations to its source material. The following diagram shows how the systems connect together. 
 
Because geospatial data is often structured and in a GIS, you can connect the GIS to the LLM using tools and agents instead of knowledge bases. 
Tools and agents (to control a UI and a system) 
Many LLMs, such as Anthropic’s Claude on Amazon Bedrock, make it possible to provide a description of tools available so your AI model can generate text to invoke external processes. These processes might retrieve live information, such as the current weather in a location or querying a structured data store, or might control external systems, such as starting a workflow or adding layers to a map. Some common geospatial functionality that you might want to integrate with your LLM using tools include: 
 
 Performing mathematical calculations like the distance between coordinates, filtering datasets based on numeric values, or calculating derived fields 
 Deriving information from predictive analysis models 
 Looking up points of interest in structured data stores 
 Searching content and metadata in unstructured data stores 
 Retrieving real-time geospatial data, like traffic, directions, or estimated time to reach a destination 
 Visualizing distances, points of interest, or paths 
 Submitting work outputs such as analytic reports 
 Starting workflows, like ordering supplies or adjusting supply chain 
 
Tools are often implemented in AWS Lambda functions. Lambda runs code without the complexity and overhead of running servers. It handles the infrastructure management, enabling faster development, improved performance, enhanced security, and cost-efficiency. 
Amazon Bedrock offers the feature Amazon Bedrock Agents to simplify the orchestration and integration with your geospatial tools. Amazon Bedrock agents follow instructions for LLM reasoning to break down a user prompt into smaller tasks and perform actions against identified tasks from action providers. The following diagram illustrates how Amazon Bedrock Agents works. 
 
The following diagram shows how Amazon Bedrock Agents can enhance GIS solutions. 
 
Solution overview 
The following demonstration applies the concepts we’ve discussed to an earthquake analysis agent as an example. This example deploys an Amazon Bedrock agent with a knowledge base based on Amazon Redshift. The Redshift instance has two tables. One table is for earthquakes, which includes date, magnitude, latitude, and longitude. The second table holds the counites in California, described as polygon shapes. The geospatial capabilities of Amazon Redshift can relate these datasets to answer queries like which county had the most recent earthquake or which county has had the most earthquakes in the last 20 years. The Amazon Bedrock agent can generate these geospatially based queries based on natural language. 
This script creates an end-to-end pipeline that performs the following steps: 
 
 Processes geospatial data. 
 Sets up cloud infrastructure. 
 Loads and configures the spatial database. 
 Creates an AI agent for spatial analysis. 
 
In the following sections, we create this agent and test it out. 
Prerequisites 
To implement this approach, you must have an AWS account with the appropriate AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. 
Additionally, complete the following steps to set up the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI): 
 
 Confirm you have access to the latest version of the AWS CLI. 
 Sign in to the AWS CLI with your credentials. 
 Make sure ./jq is installed. If not, use the following command: 
 
 
 yum -y install jq 
 
Set up error handling 
Use the following code for the initial setup and error handling: 
 
 #!/usr/bin/env bash
set -ex

LOG_FILE="deployment_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log"
touch "$LOG_FILE"

handle_error() {
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;local exit_code=$?
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;local line_number=$1
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ]; then
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;log_error "Failed at line $line_number with exit code $exit_code"
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;exit $exit_code
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fi
}
trap 'handle_error $LINENO' ERR 
 
This code performs the following functions: 
 
 Creates a timestamped log file 
 Sets up error trapping that captures line numbers 
 Enables automatic script termination on errors 
 Implements detailed logging of failures 
 
Validate the AWS environment 
Use the following code to validate the AWS environment: 
 
 AWS_VERSION=$(aws --version 2&gt;&amp;1)
log "INFO" "AWS CLI version: $AWS_VERSION"

if ! aws sts get-caller-identity &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;log_error "AWS CLI is not configured with valid credentials"
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;exit 1
fi

AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text) 
 
This code performs the essential AWS setup verification: 
 
 Checks AWS CLI installation 
 Validates AWS credentials 
 Retrieves account ID for resource naming 
 
Set up Amazon Redshift and Amazon Bedrock variables 
Use the following code to create Amazon Redshift and Amazon Bedrock variables: 
 
 REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_IDENTIFIER="geo-analysis-cluster"
REDSHIFT_DATABASE="geo_db"
REDSHIFT_MASTER_USER= [Create username]
REDSHIFT_MASTER_PASSWORD= [Create Password]
REDSHIFT_NODE_TYPE="dc2.large"
REDSHIFT_CLUSTER_TYPE="single-node"
BEDROCK_ROLE_NAME="BedrockGeospatialRole"
# Bedrock Configuration
AGENT_NAME="GeoAgentRedshift"
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME="GeospatialKB" 
 
Create IAM roles for Amazon Redshift and Amazon S3 
Use the following code to set up IAM roles for Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift: 
 
 if aws iam get-role --role-name "$REDSHIFT_ROLE_NAME" &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then
    REDSHIFT_ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role --role-name "$REDSHIFT_ROLE_NAME" --query 'Role.Arn' --output text)
    log "INFO" "Using existing role ARN: $REDSHIFT_ROLE_ARN"
else
    # Create trust policy document
    cat &gt; /tmp/trust-policy.json &lt;&lt; EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "redshift.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
    # Create role
    CREATE_ROLE_OUTPUT=$(aws iam create-role \
        --role-name "$REDSHIFT_ROLE_NAME" \
        --assume-role-policy-document "file:///tmp/trust-policy.json" \
        --description "Role for Redshift to access S3" 2&gt;&amp;1)
    
    REDSHIFT_ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role --role-name "$REDSHIFT_ROLE_NAME" --query 'Role.Arn' --output text)
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        log_error "Failed to create role:"
        exit 1
    fi
    REDSHIFT_ROLE_ARN=$(echo "$CREATE_ROLE_OUTPUT" | jq -r '.Role.Arn')
    # Wait for role to be available
    sleep 10
fi
ATTACH_POLICY_OUTPUT=$(aws iam attach-role-policy \
    --role-name "$REDSHIFT_ROLE_NAME" \
    --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" 2&gt;&amp;1)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    if echo "$ATTACH_POLICY_OUTPUT" | grep -q "EntityAlreadyExists"; then
    else
        exit 1
    fi
fi 
 
Prepare the data and Amazon S3 
Use the following code to prepare the data and Amazon S3 storage: 
 
 DATA_BUCKET="geospatial-bedrock-demo-data-${AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}"
aws s3 mb s3://$DATA_BUCKET

# Download source data
curl -o earthquakes.csv https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/master/samples/data/earthquake-data/earthquakes.csv
curl -o california-counties.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Esri/gis-tools-for-hadoop/master/samples/data/counties-data/california-counties.json 
 
This code sets up data storage and retrieval through the following steps: 
 
 Creates a unique S3 bucket 
 Downloads earthquake and county boundary data 
 Prepares for data transformation 
 
Transform geospatial data 
Use the following code to transform the geospatial data: 
 
 INPUT_FILE="california-counties.json"
OUTPUT_FILE="california-counties.csv"

# Create CSV header

Test the solution 
Let’s observe the system behavior with the following natural language user inputs in the chat window. 
Example 1: Summarization and Q&amp;A 
For this example, we use the prompt “Summarize which zones allow for building of an apartment.” 
The LLM performs retrieval with a RAG approach, then uses the retrieved residential code documents as context to answer the user’s query in natural language. 
 
This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for hallucination mitigation, RAG, and summarization. 
Example 2: Generate a draft report 
Next, we input the prompt “Write me a report on how various zones and related housing data can be utilized to plan new housing development to meet high demand.” 
The LLM retrieves relevant urban planning code documents, then summarizes the information into a standard reporting format as described in its system prompt. 
 
This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for prompt templates, RAG, and summarization. 
Example 3: Show places on the map 
For this example, we use the prompt “Show me the low density properties on Abbeville street in Macgregor on the map with their address.” 
The LLM creates a chain of thought to look up which properties match the user’s query and then invokes the draw marker tool on the map. The LLM provides tool invocation parameters in its scratchpad, awaits the completion of these tool invocations, then responds in natural language with a bulleted list of markers placed on the map. 
 
 
This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for chain of thought reasoning, tool use, retrieval systems using agents, and UI control. 
Example 4: Use the UI as context 
For this example, we choose a marker on a map and input the prompt “Can I build an apartment here.” 
The “here” is not contextualized from conversation history but rather from the state of the map view. Having a state engine that can relay information from a frontend view to the LLM input adds a richer context. 
The LLM understands the context of “here” based on the selected marker, performs retrieval to see the land development policy, and responds to the user in simple natural language, “No, and here is why…” 
 
This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for UI context, chain of thought reasoning, RAG, and tool use. 
Example 5: UI context and UI control 
Next, we choose a marker on the map and input the prompt “draw a .25 mile circle around here so I can visualize walking distance.” 
The LLM invokes the draw circle tool to create a layer on the map centered at the selected marker, contextualized by “here.” 
 
This example demonstrates the LLM capabilities for UI context, chain of thought reasoning, tool use, and UI control.

• Beyond the basics: A comprehensive foundation model selection framework for generative AI
  Most organizations evaluating foundation models limit their analysis to three primary dimensions: accuracy, latency, and cost. While these metrics provide a useful starting point, they represent an oversimplification of the complex interplay of factors that determine real-world model performance. 
Foundation models have revolutionized how enterprises develop generative AI applications, offering unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like content. However, as the model landscape expands, organizations face complex scenarios when selecting the right foundation model for their applications. In this blog post we present a systematic evaluation methodology for Amazon Bedrock users, combining theoretical frameworks with practical implementation strategies that empower data scientists and machine learning (ML) engineers to make optimal model selections. 
The challenge of foundation model selection 
Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies such as&nbsp;AI21 Labs,&nbsp;Anthropic,&nbsp;Cohere,&nbsp;DeepSeek,&nbsp;Luma,&nbsp;Meta,&nbsp;Mistral AI,&nbsp;poolside&nbsp;(coming soon),&nbsp;Stability AI,&nbsp;TwelveLabs&nbsp;(coming soon),&nbsp;Writer, and&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;through a single API, along with a broad set of capabilities you need to build generative AI applications with security, privacy, and responsible AI. The service’s API-driven approach allows seamless model interchangeability, but this flexibility introduces a critical challenge: which model will deliver optimal performance for a specific application while meeting operational constraints? 
Our research with enterprise customers reveals that many early generative AI projects select models based on either limited manual testing or reputation, rather than systematic evaluation against business requirements. This approach frequently results in: 
 
 Over-provisioning computational resources to accommodate larger models than required 
 Sub-optimal performance because of misalignment between model strengths and use case requirements 
 Unnecessarily high operational costs because of inefficient token utilization 
 Production performance issues discovered too late in the development lifecycle 
 
In this post, we outline a comprehensive evaluation methodology optimized for Amazon Bedrock implementations using Amazon Bedrock Evaluations while providing forward-compatible patterns as the foundation model landscape evolves. To read more about on how to evaluate large language model (LLM) performance, see LLM-as-a-judge on Amazon Bedrock Model Evaluation. 
A multidimensional evaluation framework—Foundation model capability matrix 
Foundation models vary significantly across multiple dimensions, with performance characteristics that interact in complex ways. Our capability matrix provides a structured view of critical dimensions to consider when evaluating models in Amazon Bedrock. Below are four core dimensions (in no specific order) – Task performance, Architectural characteristics, Operational considerations, and Responsible AI attributes. 
Task performance 
Evaluating the models based on the task performance is crucial for achieving direct impact on business outcomes, ROI, user adoption and trust, and competitive advantage. 
 
 Task-specific accuracy: Evaluate models using benchmarks relevant to your use case (MMLU, HELM, or domain-specific benchmarks). 
 Few-shot learning capabilities: Strong few-shot performers require minimal examples to adapt to new tasks, leading to cost efficiency, faster time-to-market, resource optimization, and operational benefits. 
 Instruction following fidelity: For the applications that require precise adherence to commands and constraints, it is critical to evaluate model’s instruction following fidelity. 
 Output consistency: Reliability and reproducibility across multiple runs with identical prompts. 
 Domain-specific knowledge: Model performance varies dramatically across specialized fields based on training data. Evaluate the models base on your domain-specific use-case scenarios. 
 Reasoning capabilities: Evaluate the model’s ability to perform logical inference, causal reasoning, and multi-step problem-solving. This can include reasoning such as deductive and inductive, mathematical, chain-of-thought, and so on. 
 
Architectural characteristics 
Architectural characteristics for evaluating the models are important as they directly impact the model’s performance, efficiency, and suitability for specific tasks. 
 
 Parameter count (model size): Larger models typically offer more capabilities but require greater computational resources and may have higher inference costs and latency. 
 Training data composition: Models trained on diverse, high-quality datasets tend to have better generalization abilities across different domains. 
 Model architecture: Decoder-only models excel at text generation, encoder-decoder architectures handle translation and summarization more effectively, while mixture of experts (MoE) architectures can be a powerful tool for improving the performance of both decoder-only and encoder-decoder models. Some specialized architectures focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities through techniques like chain-of-thought prompting or recursive reasoning. 
 Tokenization methodology: The way models process text affects performance on domain-specific tasks, particularly with specialized vocabulary. 
 Context window capabilities: Larger context windows enable processing more information at once, critical for document analysis and extended conversations. 
 Modality: Modality refers to type of data a model can process and generate, such as text, image, audio, or video. Consider the modality of the models depending on the use case, and choose the model optimized for that specific modality. 
 
Operational considerations 
Below listed operational considerations are critical for model selection as they directly impact the real-world feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of AI deployments. 
 
 Throughput and latency profiles: Response speed impacts user experience and throughput determines scalability. 
 Cost structures: Input/output token pricing significantly affects economics at scale. 
 Scalability characteristics: Ability to handle concurrent requests and maintain performance during traffic spikes. 
 Customization options: Fine-tuning capabilities and adaptation methods for tailoring to specific use cases or domains. 
 Ease of integration: Ease of integration into existing systems and workflow is an important consideration. 
 Security: When dealing with sensitive data, model security—including data encryption, access control, and vulnerability management—is a crucial consideration. 
 
Responsible AI attributes 
As AI becomes increasingly embedded in business operations and daily lives, evaluating models on responsible AI attributes isn’t just a technical consideration—it’s a business imperative. 
 
 Hallucination propensity: Models vary in their tendency to generate plausible but incorrect information. 
 Bias measurements: Performance across different demographic groups affects fairness and equity. 
 Safety guardrail effectiveness: Resistance to generating harmful or inappropriate content. 
 Explainability and privacy: Transparency features and handling of sensitive information. 
 Legal Implications: Legal considerations should include data privacy, non-discrimination, intellectual property, and product liability. 
 
Agentic AI considerations for model selection 
The growing popularity of agentic AI applications introduces evaluation dimensions beyond traditional metrics. When assessing models for use in autonomous agents, consider these critical capabilities: 
Agent-specific evaluation dimensions 
 
 Planning and reasoning capabilities: Evaluate chain-of-thought consistency across complex multi-step tasks and self-correction mechanisms that allow agents to identify and fix their own reasoning errors. 
 Tool and API integration: Test function calling capabilities, parameter handling precision, and structured output consistency (JSON/XML) for seamless tool use. 
 Agent-to-agent communication: Assess protocol adherence to frameworks like A2A and efficient contextual memory management across extended multi-agent interactions. 
 
Multi-agent collaboration testing for applications using multiple specialized agents 
 
 Role adherence: Measure how well models maintain distinct agent personas and responsibilities without role confusion. 
 Information sharing efficiency: Test how effectively information flows between agent instances without critical detail loss. 
 Collaborative intelligence: Verify whether multiple agents working together produce better outcomes than single-model approaches. 
 Error propagation resistance: Assess how robustly multi-agent systems contain and correct errors rather than amplifying them. 
 
A four-phase evaluation methodology 
Our recommended methodology progressively narrows model selection through increasingly sophisticated assessment techniques: 
Phase 1: Requirements engineering 
Begin with a precise specification of your application’s requirements: 
 
 Functional requirements: Define primary tasks, domain knowledge needs, language support, output formats, and reasoning complexity. 
 Non-functional requirements: Specify latency thresholds, throughput requirements, budget constraints, context window needs, and availability expectations. 
 Responsible AI requirements: Establish hallucination tolerance, bias mitigation needs, safety requirements, explainability level, and privacy constraints. 
 Agent-specific requirements: For agentic applications, define tool-use capabilities, protocol adherence standards, and collaboration requirements. 
 
Assign weights to each requirement based on business priorities to create your evaluation scorecard foundation. 
Phase 2: Candidate model selection 
Use the Amazon Bedrock model information API to filter models based on hard requirements. This typically reduces candidates from dozens to 3–7 models that are worth detailed evaluation. 
Filter options include but aren’t limited to the following: 
 
 Filter by modality support, context length, and language capabilities 
 Exclude models that don’t meet minimum performance thresholds 
 Calculate theoretical costs at projected scale so that you can exclude options that exceed the available budget 
 Filter for customization requirements such as fine-tuning capabilities 
 For agentic applications, filter for function calling and multi-agent protocol support 
 
Although the Amazon Bedrock model information API might not provide the filters you need for candidate selection, you can use the Amazon Bedrock model catalog (shown in the following figure) to obtain additional information about these models. 
 
Phase 3: Systematic performance evaluation 
Implement structured evaluation using Amazon Bedrock Evaluations: 
 
 Prepare evaluation datasets: Create representative task examples, challenging edge cases, domain-specific content, and adversarial examples. 
 Design evaluation prompts: Standardize instruction format, maintain consistent examples, and mirror production usage patterns. 
 Configure metrics: Select appropriate metrics for subjective tasks (human evaluation and reference-free quality), objective tasks (precision, recall, and F1 score), and reasoning tasks (logical consistency and step validity). 
 For agentic applications: Add protocol conformance testing, multi-step planning assessment, and tool-use evaluation. 
 Execute evaluation jobs: Maintain consistent parameters across models and collect comprehensive performance data. 
 Measure operational performance: Capture throughput, latency distributions, error rates, and actual token consumption costs. 
 
Phase 4: Decision analysis 
Transform evaluation data into actionable insights: 
 
 Normalize metrics: Scale all metrics to comparable units using min-max normalization. 
 Apply weighted scoring: Calculate composite scores based on your prioritized requirements. 
 Perform sensitivity analysis: Test how robust your conclusions are against weight variations. 
 Visualize performance: Create radar charts, efficiency frontiers, and tradeoff curves for clear comparison. 
 Document findings: Detail each model’s strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases. 
 
Advanced evaluation techniques 
Beyond standard procedures, consider the following approaches for evaluating models. 
A/B testing with production traffic 
Implement comparative testing using Amazon Bedrock’s routing capabilities to gather real-world performance data from actual users. 
Adversarial testing 
Test model vulnerabilities through prompt injection attempts, challenging syntax, edge case handling, and domain-specific factual challenges. 
Multi-model ensemble evaluation 
Assess combinations such as sequential pipelines, voting ensembles, and cost-efficient routing based on task complexity. 
Continuous evaluation architecture 
Design systems to monitor production performance with: 
 
 Stratified sampling of production traffic across task types and domains 
 Regular evaluations and trigger-based reassessments when new models emerge 
 Performance thresholds and alerts for quality degradation 
 User feedback collection and failure case repositories for continuous improvement 
 
Industry-specific considerations 
Different sectors have unique requirements that influence model selection: 
 
 Financial services: Regulatory compliance, numerical precision, and personally identifiable information (PII) handling capabilities 
 Healthcare: Medical terminology understanding, HIPAA adherence, and clinical reasoning 
 Manufacturing: Technical specification comprehension, procedural knowledge, and spatial reasoning 
 Agentic systems: Autonomous reasoning, tool integration, and protocol conformance 
 
Best practices for model selection 
Through this comprehensive approach to model evaluation and selection, organizations can make informed decisions that balance performance, cost, and operational requirements while maintaining alignment with business objectives. The methodology makes sure that model selection isn’t a one-time exercise but an evolving process that adapts to changing needs and technological capabilities. 
 
 Assess your situation thoroughly: Understand your specific use case requirements and available resources 
 Select meaningful metrics: Focus on metrics that directly relate to your business objectives 
 Build for continuous evaluation: Design your evaluation process to be repeatable as new models are released 
 
Looking forward: The future of model selection 
As foundation models evolve, evaluation methodologies must keep pace. Below are further considerations (By no means this list of considerations is exhaustive and is subject to ongoing updates as technology evolves and best practices emerge), you should take into account while selecting the best model(s) for your use-case(s). 
 
 Multi-model architectures: Enterprises will increasingly deploy specialized models in concert rather than relying on single models for all tasks. 
 Agentic landscapes: Evaluation frameworks must assess how models perform as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities and inter-agent collaboration. 
 Domain specialization: The growing landscape of domain-specific models will require more nuanced evaluation of specialized capabilities. 
 Alignment and control: As models become more capable, evaluation of controllability and alignment with human intent becomes increasingly important. 
 
Conclusion 
By implementing a comprehensive evaluation framework that extends beyond basic metrics, organizations can informed decisions about which foundation models will best serve their requirements. For agentic AI applications in particular, thorough evaluation of reasoning, planning, and collaboration capabilities is essential for success. By approaching model selection systematically, organizations can avoid the common pitfalls of over-provisioning, misalignment with use case needs, excessive operational costs, and late discovery of performance issues. The investment in thorough evaluation pays dividends through optimized costs, improved performance, and superior user experiences.

• Accelerate intelligent document processing with generative AI on AWS
  Every day, organizations process millions of documents, including invoices, contracts, insurance claims, medical records, and financial statements. Despite the critical role these documents play, an estimated 80–90% of the data they contain is unstructured and largely untapped, hiding valuable insights that could transform business outcomes. Despite advances in technology, many organizations still rely on manual data entry, spending countless hours extracting information from PDFs, scanned images, and forms. This manual approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and prevents organizations from scaling their operations and responding quickly to business demands. 
Although generative AI has made it easier to build proof-of-concept document processing solutions, the journey from proof of concept to production remains fraught with challenges. Organizations often find themselves rebuilding from scratch when they discover their prototype can’t handle production volumes, lacks proper error handling, doesn’t scale cost-effectively, or fails to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements. What works in a demo with a handful of documents often breaks down when processing thousands of documents daily in a production environment. 
In this post, we introduce our open source GenAI IDP Accelerator—a tested solution that we use to help customers across industries address their document processing challenges. Automated document processing workflows accurately extract structured information from documents, reducing manual effort. We will show you how this ready-to-deploy solution can help you build those workflows with generative AI on AWS in days instead of months. 
Understanding intelligent document processing 
Intelligent document processing (IDP) encompasses the technologies and techniques used to extract and process data from various document types. Common IDP tasks include: 
 
 OCR (Optical Character Recognition) – Converting scanned documents and images into machine-readable text 
 Document classification – Automatically identifying document types (such as invoices, contracts, or forms) 
 Data extraction – Pulling structured information from unstructured documents 
 Assessment – Evaluating the quality and confidence of extracted data 
 Summarization – Creating concise summaries of document content 
 Evaluation – Measuring accuracy and performance against expected outcomes 
 
These capabilities are critical across industries. In financial services, organizations use IDP to process loan applications, extract data from bank statements, and validate insurance claims. Healthcare providers rely on IDP to extract patient information from medical records, process insurance forms, and handle lab results efficiently. Manufacturing and logistics companies use IDP to process invoices and purchase orders, extract shipping information, and handle quality certificates. Government agencies use IDP to process citizen applications, extract data from tax forms, manage permits and licenses, and enforce regulatory compliance. 
The generative AI revolution in IDP 
Traditional IDP solutions relied on template-based extraction, regular expressions, and classical machine learning (ML) models. Though functional, these approaches required extensive setup, struggled with document variations, and achieved limited accuracy on complex documents. 
The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI has fundamentally transformed IDP capabilities. Modern AI models can understand document context, handle variations without templates, achieve near-human accuracy on complex extractions, and adapt to new document types with minimal examples. This shift from rule-based to intelligence-based processing means organizations can now process different document types with high accuracy, dramatically reducing the time and cost of implementation. 
GenAI IDP Accelerator 
We’re excited to share the GenAI IDP Accelerator—an open source solution that transforms how organizations handle document processing by dramatically reducing manual effort and improving accuracy. This serverless foundation offers processing patterns which use Amazon Bedrock Data Automation for rich out-of-the-box document processing features, high accuracy, ease of use, and straightforward per-page pricing, Amazon Bedrock state-of-the-art foundation models (FMs) for complex documents requiring custom logic, and other AWS AI services to provide a flexible, scalable starting point for enterprises to build document automation tailored to their specific needs. 
The following is a short demo of the solution in action, in this case showcasing the default Amazon Bedrock Data Automation processing pattern.
