• The Download: a new home under the sea, and cloning pets
  This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology.



The first new subsea habitat in 40 years is about to launch



Vanguard feels and smells like a new RV. It has long, gray banquettes that convert into bunks, a microwave cleverly hidden under a counter, a functional steel sink with a French press and crockery above. A weird little toilet hides behind a curtain.



But you can’t just fire up Vanguard’s engine and roll off the lot. Once it is sealed and moved to its permanent home beneath the waves of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary early next year, Vanguard will be the world’s first new subsea habitat in nearly four decades.Teams of four scientists will live and work on the seabed for a week at a time, entering and leaving the habitat as scuba divers. Read our story about some of their potential missions.

Cloning isn’t just for celebrity pets like Tom Brady’s dog



This week, we heard that Tom Brady had his dog cloned. The former quarterback revealed that his Junie is actually a clone of Lua, a pit bull mix that died in 2023.



Brady’s announcement follows those of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Barbra Streisand, who also famously cloned their pet dogs. But some believe there are better ways to make use of cloning technologies, such as diversifying the genetic pools of inbred species, or potentially bringing other animals back from the brink of extinction.

Finding forgotten Indigenous landscapes with electromagnetic technology



The fertile river valleys of the American Midwest hide tens of thousands of Indigenous earthworks, according to experts: geometric structures consisting of walls, mounds, ditches, and berms, some dating back nearly 3,000 years.Archaeologists now believe that the earthworks functioned as religious gathering places, tombs for culturally important clans, and annual calendars, perhaps all at the same time. They can take the form of giant circles and squares, cloverleafs and octagons, complex S-curves and simple mounds.Until recently, it seemed as if much of the continent’s pre-European archaeological heritage had been carelessly wiped out, uprooted, and lost for good. But traces remain: electromagnetic remnants in the soil that can be detected using specialty surveying equipment. And archaeologists and tribal historians are working together to uncover them.

• The first new subsea habitat in 40 years is about to launch
  Vanguard feels and smells like a new RV. It has long, gray banquettes that convert into bunks, a microwave cleverly hidden under a counter, a functional steel sink with a French press and crockery above. A weird little toilet hides behind a curtain.



But some clues hint that you can’t just fire up Vanguard’s engine and roll off the lot. The least subtle is its door, a massive disc of steel complete with a wheel that spins to lock.



COURTESY MARK HARRIS




Once it is sealed and moved to its permanent home beneath the waves of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary early next year, Vanguard will be the world’s first new subsea habitat in nearly four decades. Teams of four scientists will live and work on the seabed for a week at a time, entering and leaving the habitat as scuba divers. Their missions could include reef restoration, species surveys, underwater archaeology, or even astronaut training.&nbsp;



One of Vanguard’s modules, unappetizingly named the “wet porch,” has a permanent opening in the floor (a.k.a. a “moon pool”) that doesn’t flood because Vanguard’s air pressure is matched to the water around it.&nbsp;



It is this pressurization that makes the habitat so useful. Scuba divers working at its maximum operational depth of 50 meters would typically need to make a lengthy stop on their way back to the surface to avoid decompression sickness. This painful and potentially fatal condition, better known as the bends, develops if divers surface too quickly. A traditional 50-meter dive gives scuba divers only a handful of minutes on the seafloor, and they can make only a couple of such dives a day. With Vanguard’s atmosphere at the same pressure as the water, its aquanauts need to decompress only once, at the end of their stay. They can potentially dive for many hours every day.



That could unlock all kinds of new science and exploration. “More time in the ocean opens a world of possibility, accelerating discoveries, inspiration, solutions,” said Kristen Tertoole, Deep’s chief operating officer, at Vanguard’s unveiling in Miami in October. “The ocean is Earth’s life support system. It regulates our climate, sustains life, and holds mysteries we’ve only begun to explore, but it remains 95% undiscovered.”



COURTESY DEEP




Subsea habitats are not a new invention. Jacques Cousteau (naturally) built the first in 1962, although it was only about the size of an elevator. Larger habitats followed in the 1970s and ’80s, maxing out at around the size of Vanguard.



But the technology has come a long way since then. Vanguard uses a tethered connection to a buoy above, known as the “surface expression,” that pipes fresh air and water down to the habitat. It also hosts a diesel generator to power a Starlink internet connection and a tank to hold wastewater. Norman Smith, Deep’s chief technology officer, says the company modeled the most severe hurricanes that Florida expects over the next 20 years and designed the tether to withstand them. Even if the worst happens and the link is broken, Deep says, Vanguard has enough air, water, and energy storage to support its crew for at least 72 hours.



That number came from DNV, an independent classification agency that inspects and certifies all types of marine vessels so that they can get commercial insurance. Vanguard will be the first subsea habitat to get a DNV classification. “That means you have to deal with the rules and all the challenging, frustrating things that come along with it, but it means that on a foundational level, it’s going to be safe,” says Patrick Lahey, founder of Triton Submarines, a manufacturer of classed submersibles.



JASON KOERNER/GETTY IMAGES FOR DEEP




Although Deep hopes Vanguard itself will enable decades of useful science, its prime function for the company is to prove out technologies for its planned successor, an advanced modular habitat called Sentinel. Sentinel modules will be six meters wide, twice the diameter of Vanguard, complete with sweeping staircases and single-occupant cabins. A small deployment might have a crew of eight, about the same as the International Space Station. A big Sentinel system could house 50, up to 225 meters deep. Deep claims that Sentinel will be launched at some point in 2027.



Ultimately, according to its mission statement, Deep seeks to “make humans aquatic,” an indication that permanent communities are on its long-term road map.&nbsp;



Deep has not publicly disclosed the identity of its principal funder, but business records in the UK indicate that as of January 31, 2025 a Canadian man, Robert MacGregor, owned at least 75% of its holding company. According to a Reuters investigation, MacGregor was once linked with Craig Steven Wright, a computer scientist who claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto, as bitcoin’s elusive creator is pseudonymously known. However, Wright’s claims to be Nakamoto later collapsed.&nbsp;



MacGregor has kept a very low public profile in recent years. When contacted for comment, Deep spokesperson Mike Bohan refused to comment on the link with Wright, only to say it was inaccurate, but said: “Robert MacGregor started his career as an IP lawyer in the dot-com era, moving into blockchain technology and has diverse interests including philanthropy, real estate, and now Deep.”



In any case, MacGregor could find keeping that low profile more difficult if Vanguard is successful in reinvigorating ocean science and exploration as the company hopes. The habitat is due to be deployed early next year, following final operational tests at Triton’s facility in Florida. It will welcome its first scientists shortly after.&nbsp;



“The ocean is not just our resource; it is our responsibility,” says Tertoole. “Deep is more than a single habitat. We are building a full-stack capability for human presence in the ocean.”

• Cloning isn’t just for celebrity pets like Tom Brady’s dog
  This week, we heard that Tom Brady had his dog cloned. The former quarterback revealed that his Junie is actually a clone of Lua, a pit bull mix that died in 2023.



Brady’s announcement follows those of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Barbra Streisand, who also famously cloned their pet dogs. But some believe there are better ways to make use of cloning technologies.





While the pampered pooches of the rich and famous may dominate this week’s headlines, cloning technologies are also being used to diversify the genetic pools of inbred species and potentially bring other animals back from the brink of extinction.



Cloning itself isn’t new. The first mammal cloned from an adult cell, Dolly the sheep, was born in the 1990s. The technology has been used in livestock breeding over the decades since.



Say you’ve got a particularly large bull, or a cow that has an especially high milk yield. Those animals are valuable. You could selectively breed for those kinds of characteristics. Or you could clone the original animals—essentially creating genetic twins.



Scientists can take some of the animals’ cells, freeze them, and store them in a biobank. That opens the option to clone them in the future. It’s possible to thaw those cells, remove the DNA-containing nuclei of the cells, and insert them into donor egg cells.



Those donor egg cells, which come from another animal of the same species, have their own nuclei removed. So it’s a case of swapping out the DNA. The resulting cell is stimulated and grown in the lab until it starts to look like an embryo. Then it is transferred to the uterus of a surrogate animal—which eventually gives birth to a clone.



There are a handful of companies offering to clone pets. Viagen, which claims to have “cloned more animals than anyone else on Earth,” will clone a dog or cat for $50,000. That’s the company that cloned Streisand’s pet dog Samantha, twice.



This week, Colossal Biosciences—the “de-extinction” company that claims to have resurrected the dire wolf and created a “woolly mouse” as a precursor to reviving the woolly mammoth—announced that it had acquired Viagen, but that Viagen will “continue to operate under its current leadership.”



Pet cloning is controversial, for a few reasons. The companies themselves point out that, while the cloned animal will be a genetic twin of the original animal, it won’t be identical. One issue is mitochondrial DNA—a tiny fraction of DNA that sits outside the nucleus and is inherited from the mother. The cloned animal may inherit some of this from the surrogate.



Mitochondrial DNA is unlikely to have much of an impact on the animal itself. More important are the many, many factors thought to shape an individual’s personality and temperament. “It’s the old nature-versus-nurture question,” says Samantha Wisely, a conservation geneticist at the University of Florida. After all, human identical twins are never carbon copies of each other. Anyone who clones a pet expecting a like-for-like reincarnation is likely to be disappointed.





And some animal welfare groups are opposed to the practice of pet cloning. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) described it as “a horror show,” and the UK’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) says that “there is no justification for cloning animals for such trivial purposes.” 



But there are other uses for cloning technology that are arguably less trivial. Wisely has long been interested in diversifying the gene pool of the critically endangered black-footed ferret, for example.



Today, there are around 10,000 black-footed ferrets that have been captively bred from only seven individuals, says Wisely. That level of inbreeding isn’t good for any species—it tends to leave organisms at risk of poor health. They are less able to reproduce or adapt to changes in their environment.



Wisely and her colleagues had access to frozen tissue samples taken from two other ferrets. Along with colleagues at not-for-profit Revive and Restore, the team created clones of those two individuals. The first clone, Elizabeth Ann, was born in 2020. Since then, other clones have been born, and the team has started breeding the cloned animals with the descendants of the other seven ferrets, says Wisely.



The same approach has been used to clone the endangered Przewalski’s horse, using decades-old tissue samples stored by the San Diego Zoo. It’s too soon to predict the impact of these efforts. Researchers are still evaluating the cloned ferrets and their offspring to see if they behave like typical animals and could survive in the wild.



Even this practice is not without its critics. Some have pointed out that cloning alone will not save any species. After all, it doesn’t address the habitat loss or human-wildlife conflict that is responsible for the endangerment of these animals in the first place. And there will always be detractors who accuse people who clone animals of “playing God.” 



For all her involvement in cloning endangered ferrets, Wisely tells me she would not consider cloning her own pets. She currently has three rescue dogs, a rescue cat, and “geriatric chickens.” “I love them all dearly,” she says. “But there are a lot of rescue animals out there that need homes.”

Stop worrying about your AI footprint. Look at the big picture instead.

As a climate technology reporter, I’m often asked by people whether they should be using AI, given how awful it is for the environment. Generally, I tell them not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want.That response might surprise some. I promise I’m not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals. Here’s why.

Ethically sourced “spare” human bodies could revolutionize medicineMany challenges in medicine stem, in large part, from a common root cause: a severe shortage of ethically-sourced human bodies.There might be a way to get out of this moral and scientific deadlock. Recent advances in biotechnology now provide a pathway to producing living human bodies without the neural components that allow us to think, be aware, or feel pain.Many will find this possibility disturbing, but if researchers and policymakers can find a way to pull these technologies together, we may one day be able to create “spare” bodies, both human and nonhuman.

We can still have nice things



A place for comfort, fun and distraction to brighten up your day. (Got any ideas? Drop me a line or skeet &#8217;em at me.)



+ Make sure to look up so you don’t miss November’s supermoon.+ If you keep finding yourself mindlessly scrolling (and who doesn’t?), maybe this whopping six-pound phone case could solve your addiction.+ Life lessons from a 101-year old who has no plans to retire.+ Are you a fan of movement snacking?
• Stop worrying about your AI footprint. Look at the big picture instead.
  Picture it: I’m minding my business at a party, parked by the snack table (of course). A friend of a friend wanders up, and we strike up a conversation. It quickly turns to work, and upon learning that I’m a climate technology reporter, my new acquaintance says something like: “Should I be using AI? I’ve heard it’s awful for the environment.”&nbsp;





This actually happens pretty often now. Generally, I tell people not to worry—let a chatbot plan your vacation, suggest recipe ideas, or write you a poem if you want.&nbsp;



That response might surprise some people, but I promise I’m not living under a rock, and I have seen all the concerning projections about how much electricity AI is using. Data centers could consume up to 945 terawatt-hours annually by 2030. (That’s roughly as much as Japan.)&nbsp;



But I feel strongly about not putting the onus on individuals, partly because AI concerns remind me so much of another question: “What should I do to reduce my carbon footprint?”&nbsp;



That one gets under my skin because of the context: BP helped popularize the concept of a carbon footprint in a marketing campaign in the early 2000s. That framing effectively shifts the burden of worrying about the environment from fossil-fuel companies to individuals.&nbsp;



The reality is, no one person can address climate change alone: Our entire society is built around burning fossil fuels. To address climate change, we need political action and public support for researching and scaling up climate technology. We need companies to innovate and take decisive action to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Focusing too much on individuals is a distraction from the real solutions on the table.&nbsp;





I see something similar today with AI. People are asking climate reporters at barbecues whether they should feel guilty about using chatbots too frequently when we need to focus on the bigger picture.&nbsp;



Big tech companies are playing into this narrative by providing energy-use estimates for their products at the user level. A couple of recent reports put the electricity used to query a chatbot at about 0.3 watt-hours, the same as powering a microwave for about a second. That’s so small as to be virtually insignificant.



But stopping with the energy use of a single query obscures the full truth, which is that this industry is growing quickly, building energy-hungry infrastructure at a nearly incomprehensible scale to satisfy the AI appetites of society as a whole. Meta is currently building a data center in Louisiana with five gigawatts of computational power—about the same demand as the entire state of Maine at the summer peak.&nbsp; (To learn more, read our Power Hungry series online.)





Increasingly, there’s no getting away from AI, and it’s not as simple as choosing to use or not use the technology. Your favorite search engine likely gives you an AI summary at the top of your search results. Your email provider’s suggested replies? Probably AI. Same for chatting with customer service while you’re shopping online.&nbsp;



Just as with climate change, we need to look at this as a system rather than a series of individual choices.&nbsp;



Massive tech companies using AI in their products should be disclosing their total energy and water use and going into detail about how they complete their calculations. Estimating the burden per query is a start, but we also deserve to see how these impacts add up for billions of users, and how that’s changing over time as companies (hopefully) make their products more efficient. Lawmakers should be mandating these disclosures, and we should be asking for them, too.&nbsp;



That’s not to say there’s absolutely no individual action that you can take. Just as you could meaningfully reduce your individual greenhouse-gas emissions by taking fewer flights and eating less meat, there are some reasonable things that you can do to reduce your AI footprint. Generating videos tends to be especially energy-intensive, as does using reasoning models to engage with long prompts and produce long answers. Asking a chatbot to help plan your day, suggest fun activities to do with your family, or summarize a ridiculously long email has relatively minor impact.&nbsp;



Ultimately, as long as you aren’t relentlessly churning out AI slop, you shouldn’t be too worried about your individual AI footprint. But we should all be keeping our eye on what this industry will mean for our grid, our society, and our planet.&nbsp;

• Cloudflare Scrubs Aisuru Botnet from Top Domains List
  For the past week, domains associated with the massive Aisuru botnet have repeatedly usurped Amazon, Apple, Google and Microsoft in Cloudflare&#8217;s public ranking of the most frequently requested websites. Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru&#8217;s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company&#8217;s domain name system (DNS) service.
The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.
Aisuru is a rapidly growing botnet comprising hundreds of thousands of hacked Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. The botnet has increased in size and firepower significantly since its debut in 2024, demonstrating the ability to launch record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks nearing 30 terabits of data per second.
Until recently, Aisuru&#8217;s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google &#8212; specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare&#8217;s main DNS server &#8212; 1.1.1.1 &#8212; and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare&#8217;s top domain rankings.
As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone&#8217;s street address in Massachusetts followed by &#8220;.com&#8221;. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.
Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:
&#8220;Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.&#8221;

Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told KrebsOnSecurity the company&#8217;s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.
&#8220;The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,&#8221; Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. &#8220;We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.&#8221;
Renee Burton, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm Infoblox, said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.
&#8220;Cloudflare&#8217;s documentation is clear &#8212; they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,&#8221; Burton wrote on LinkedIn. &#8220;There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.&#8221;
Alex Greenland is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm Epi. Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare&#8217;s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they&#8217;re still not meant to be there.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a failure on Cloudflare&#8217;s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,&#8221; he said.
Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.
&#8220;They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they&#8217;re good at this),&#8221; Greenland wrote on LinkedIn. &#8220;So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.&#8221;
Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like TRANCO.
&#8220;TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare&#8217;s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.&#8221;
Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.
According to Cloudflare&#8217;s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains &#8212; nearly 52 percent &#8212; originated from the United States. This tracks with my reporting from early October, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Verizon.
Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su&#8217;s Wikipedia page says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).
A Cloudflare blog post from October 27 found that .su had the highest &#8220;DNS magnitude&#8221; of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare&#8217;s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it&#8217;s worth noting that servers for the world-building game Minecraft were some of Aisuru&#8217;s most frequent targets].
A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.

• When industry knowledge meets PIKE-RAG: The innovation behind Signify’s customer service boost
  As a world leader in connected LED lighting products, systems, and services, Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) serves not only everyday consumers but also a large number of professional users who have stringent requirements for technical specifications and engineering compatibility. Faced with thousands of product models, complex component parameters, and technical documentation spanning multiple versions, delivering accurate, professional answers efficiently has become a core challenge for Signify’s knowledge management system.



To address this challenge, Signify (opens in new tab) collaborated with Microsoft Research Asia on a proof-of-concept (PoC) using PIKE-RAG technology, integrating it into their upgraded knowledge management system built on Microsoft Azure. The result: a 12% improvement in answer accuracy.



Challenges of applying RAG in lighting



In an era where AI is rapidly transforming how enterprises manage information, Signify recognized the strategic importance of precise and efficient knowledge systems. It adopted large AI models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to better support its wide range of customer inquiries.



Yet applying RAG to lighting scenarios involving professional users presented unique challenges. Product data spanned multimodal documents, unstructured tables, and complex product parameters, demanding continuous customization that slowed development and limited scalability. Despite improvements through keyword tuning, system optimization, and refined prompts, Signify sought more advanced approaches to further raise accuracy and reliability.



Seeking to unlock greater value from its knowledge management system, Signify began exploring more suitable technical solutions that are better aligned with their professional use cases. Upon learning that PIKE-RAG had been successfully applied in domains like healthcare and law, significantly improving information accuracy, Signify worked with Microsoft Research Asia on a PoC of PIKE-RAG on Microsoft Azure.



How PIKE-RAG addressed Signify’s pain points



Compared to traditional RAG, PIKE-RAG efficiently retrieves textual information and also understands multimodal content like charts and tables. Its built-in domain adaptation module quickly learns reasoning patterns aligned with specific domains to generate responses that are consistent with engineering contexts. These differentiated advantages stem from PIKE-RAG’s unique approach to understanding and processing professional knowledge. In Signify’s use case, this manifests in three key areas:



Multimodal document parsing and learning of industry-specific reasoning patterns



Signify’s product documentation includes diverse formats, such as nonstandard tables (e.g., comparison charts of voltage ranges under different currents) and circuit diagrams (e.g., driver power limits). Traditional systems often fail to process this information effectively—either ignoring it or extracting disorganized text fragments.



PIKE-RAG integrates Microsoft Research Asia’s Document Intelligence technology with Microsoft Azure OpenAI models to accurately identify table structures and parse key parameters in circuit diagrams. For example, when a customer service agent queries, “What is the output voltage of a specific driver model at 0.15A current,” the system automatically locates the curve chart in the document and infers a range of 40–54V based on the current interval—an area where traditional systems frequently err, due to their inability to “read” diagrams.



End-to-end knowledge loop, eliminating reliance on erroneous data sources



Enterprise knowledge systems often integrate data from multiple sources, which can lead to discrepancies, especially when database updates are not fully synchronized. PIKE-RAG captures diverse information sources and establishes citation relationships, supporting complex reasoning tasks that rely on multi-source data.



In other words, PIKE-RAG can directly use original documents as data sources, efficiently parsing and understanding product manuals and PDF charts. By extracting key information from these text- and graphic-rich documents, PIKE-RAG enables more efficient and trustworthy knowledge retrieval.



Dynamic task decomposition and multi-hop reasoning for precise answers to complex questions



Traditional RAG systems typically follow a “one question, one answer” model and struggle with multi-step reasoning. In Signify’s lighting domain, customer inquiries often involve multi-level associations. PIKE-RAG dynamically decomposes user questions into executable subtasks and solves them through multi-hop reasoning. For example, when asked, “List all bases compatible with the G8 series lamps,” if no document directly provides the answer, PIKE-RAG’s reasoning proceeds as follows:



Step 1: The system identifies implicit knowledge. One document notes that the G7 and G8 series have identical dimensions and that all bases compatible with the G7 series are also compatible with the G8 series.&nbsp;



Step 2: Based on this, the system retrieves the base list for the G7 series.&nbsp;



Step 3: Since the list uses abbreviations, the system searches for a table that maps abbreviations to full names and generates a complete list of G8-compatible bases.&nbsp;



Through this automated multi-hop reasoning, the system delivers accurate and complete answers.



Figure 1: PIKE-RAG orchestrates and integrates heterogeneous information in multi-source and multimodal environments. 



Testing showed that the PIKE-RAG-powered knowledge management platform provided a significant advantage. It achieved a 12% improvement in performance compared with the original system.



These results were achieved without any question-specific customization, only algorithmic optimization, demonstrating precise knowledge matching and generation. As the system continues to learn and integrate Signify’s proprietary knowledge, accuracy is expected to improve further.



“In the PoC for our product specification insight tool, PIKE-RAG helped us significantly improve the original system’s performance. This will enhance overall customer satisfaction. We’re currently evaluating PIKE-RAG’s application path from multiple angles, including technical implementation, cost control, and future adaptability, and we look forward to deepening our collaboration with Microsoft Research Asia to drive further innovation,” said Haitao Liu, head of Signify Research China.



“It’s also worth noting that the researchers at Microsoft Research Asia demonstrated strong industry knowledge and rigorous scientific methodology. They proactively studied and analyzed the issues, tracing and clarifying the root causes of our issues to make PIKE-RAG better suited to Signify’s real-world needs.”



Beyond lighting: Generalization across industries



In Signify’s successful test, PIKE-RAG demonstrated strong generalization capabilities in complex industrial scenarios, enabling rapid cross-domain adaptation. Its three core strengths are:




Support for self-evolution and continuous learning: PIKE-RAG continuously analyzes error cases in interaction logs and uses evolutionary algorithms to automatically optimize knowledge extraction strategies, such as trying different table parsing methods or adjusting multimodal content weights. Validated strategies are then solidified for future Q&amp;A, allowing the system to adapt to new knowledge types without manual intervention.&nbsp;



Modular architecture driven by capability needs: PIKE-RAG flexibly combines modules for document parsing, knowledge extraction, storage, retrieval, organization, knowledge-centered reasoning, and task decomposition. It dynamically adjusts focus areas based on scenario needs (e.g., fact retrieval, multi-hop reasoning, innovative generation) and flexibly builds RAG methods that adapt to real-world applications, efficiently handling various complex tasks.&nbsp;



Strong adaptation to domain-specific reasoning patterns: With dynamic updates through the Domain Tips feature, enterprises can add domain-specific logic (e.g., “the maximum output voltage of an LED driver should be the maximum of the operating range, not the spec sheet’s max output”) in real time, enabling the system to process information according to professional engineering standards and follow industry conventions.&nbsp;




Figure 2: Overview of the PIKE-RAG framework



PIKE-RAG’s generalization capabilities have been validated not only in Signify’s knowledge management platform but also in pilot applications across industries like manufacturing, mining, and pharmaceuticals—significantly improving Q&amp;A system accuracy.



“A leader in lighting, Signify presents a complex industrial knowledge system with a highly challenging real-world scenario for PIKE-RAG. Through this collaboration, we validated that PIKE-RAG’s general approach can greatly improve the accuracy of professional knowledge Q&amp;A and accelerate scenario customization. Our researchers also gained valuable experience in handling domain-specific data,” explained Jiang Bian, partner research manager at Microsoft Research Asia.



“Our goal isn’t to build a universal chatbot but to create a professional assistant that aligns with domain-specific logic and performs rigorous knowledge reasoning. That’s the true driving force behind intelligent transformation in industrial knowledge management.”

• Magentic Marketplace: an open-source simulation environment for studying agentic markets
  Autonomous AI agents are here, and they&#8217;re poised to reshape the economy. By automating discovery, negotiation, and transactions, agents can overcome inefficiencies like information asymmetries and platform lock-in, enabling faster, more transparent, and more competitive markets.



We are already seeing early signs of this transformation in digital marketplaces. Customer-facing assistants like OpenAI’s Operator and Anthropic’s Computer Use can navigate websites and complete purchases. On the business side, Shopify Sidekick, Salesforce Einstein, and Meta’s Business AI help merchants with operations and customer engagement. These examples hint at a future where agents become active market participants, but the structure of these markets remains uncertain.



Several scenarios are possible. We might see one-sided markets where only customers or businesses deploy agents; closed platforms (known as walled gardens) where companies tightly control agent interactions; or even open two-sided marketplaces where customer and business agents transact freely across ecosystems. Each path carries different trade-offs for security, openness, convenience, and competition, which will shape how value flows in the digital economy. For a deeper exploration of these dynamics, see our paper, The Agentic Economy.



To help navigate this uncertainty, we built Magentic Marketplace (opens in new tab)— an open-source simulation environment for exploring the numerous possibilities of agentic markets and their societal implications at scale. It provides a foundation for studying these markets and guiding them toward outcomes that benefit everyone.



This matters because most AI agent research focuses on isolated scenarios—a single agent completing a task or two agents negotiating a simple transaction. But real markets involve a large number of agents simultaneously searching, communicating, and transacting, creating complex dynamics that can’t be understood by studying agents in isolation. Capturing this complexity is essential because real-world deployments raise critical questions about consumer welfare, market efficiency, fairness, manipulation resistance, and bias—questions that can’t be safely answered in production environments.



To explore these dynamics in depth, the Magentic Marketplace platform enables controlled experimentation across diverse agentic marketplace scenarios. Its current focus is on two-sided markets, but the environment is modular and extensible, supporting future exploration of mixed human–agent systems, one-sided markets, and complex communication protocols.



Figure 1. With Magentic Marketplace, researchers can model how agents representing customers and businesses interact—shedding light on the dynamics that could shape future digital markets.



What is Magentic Marketplace?



Magentic Marketplace’s environment manages market-wide capabilities like maintaining catalogs of available goods and services, implementing discovery algorithms, facilitating agent-to-agent communication, and handling simulated payments through a centralized transaction layer at its core, which ensures transaction integrity across all marketplace interactions. Additionally, the platform enables systematic, reproducible research. As demonstrated in the following video, it supports a wide range of agent implementations and evolving marketplace features, allowing researchers to integrate diverse agent architectures and adapt the environment as new capabilities emerge.









We built Magentic Marketplace around three core architectural choices:



HTTP/REST client-server architecture: Agents operate as independent clients while the Marketplace Environment serves as a central server. This mirrors real-world platforms and supports clear separation of customer and business agent roles.



Minimal&nbsp;three-endpoint&nbsp;market&nbsp;protocol:&nbsp;Just&nbsp;three endpoints—register, protocol discovery, and action execution—lets&nbsp;agents dynamically discover available actions.&nbsp;New capabilities&nbsp;can&nbsp;be added without disrupting existing experiments.



Rich action protocol: Specific message types support the complete transaction lifecycle: search, negotiation, proposals, and payments. The protocol is designed for extensibility. New actions like refunds, reviews, or ratings can be added seamlessly, allowing researchers to evolve marketplace capabilities and study emerging agent behaviors while remaining compatible.



Figure 2. Magentic Marketplace includes two agent types: Assistant Agents (customers) and Service Agents (businesses). Both interact with a central Market Environment via REST APIs for registration, service discovery, communication, and transaction execution. Action Routers manage message flow and protocol requests, enabling autonomous negotiation and commerce in a two-sided marketplace.



Additionally, a visualization module lets users observe marketplace dynamics and review individual conversation threads between customer and business agents.



Setting up the experiments



To ensure reproducibility, we instantiated the marketplace with fully synthetic data, available in our open-source repository (opens in new tab). The experiments modeled transactions such as ordering food and engaging with home improvement services, where agents represented customers and businesses engaging in marketplace transactions. This setup enabled precise measurement of behavior and systematic comparison against theoretical upper bounds.



Each experiment was run using 100 customers and 300 businesses and included both proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash) and open-source models (OSS-20b, Qwen3-14b, and Qwen3-4b-Instruct-2507).



Our scenarios focused on simple all-or-nothing requests: Each customer had a list of desired items and amenities that needed to be present for a transaction to be satisfying. For those transactions, utility was computed as the sum of the customer’s internal item valuations minus actual prices paid. Consumer welfare, defined as the sum of utilities across all completed transactions, served as our key metric for comparing agent performance.



While this experimental setup provides a useful starting point, it is not intended to be definitive. We encourage researchers to extend the framework with richer, more nuanced measures and request types that better capture real consumer welfare, fairness, and other societal considerations.

What did we find?



Agents can improve consumer welfare—but only with good discovery



We explored whether two-sided agentic markets—where AI agents interact with each other and with service providers—can improve consumer welfare by reducing information gaps. Unlike traditional markets, which do not provide agentic support and place the full burden of overcoming information asymmetries on customers, agentic markets shift much of that effort to agents. This change matters because as agents gain better tools for discovery and communication, they relieve customers of the heavy cognitive load of filling any information gaps. This lowers the cost of making informed decisions and improves customer outcomes.



We compared several marketplace setups. Under realistic conditions (Agentic: Lexical search), agents faced real-world challenges like building queries, navigating paginated lists, identifying the right businesses to send inquiries to, and negotiating transactions.



Despite these complexities, advanced proprietary models and some medium-sized open-source models like GPTOSS-20b outperformed simple baselines like randomly choosing or simply choosing the cheapest option. Notably, GPT-5 achieved near-optimal performance, demonstrating its ability to effectively gather and utilize decision-relevant information in realistic marketplace conditions.



Figure 3. Table comparing experimental setups for welfare outcomes in the restaurant industry. Each row shows a different way agents or baselines make decisions, from random picks to fully coordinated agentic strategies. Cell colors indicate how much information is available: green, at the top left, represents complete information, red, at the top right, represents limited information, and yellow at the bottom represents decisions that depend on agent communication.



Performance increased considerably under the Agentic: Perfect search condition, where agents started with the top three matches without needing to search and navigate among the choices. In this setting, Sonnet-4.0, Sonnet-4.5, GPT-5, and GPT-4.1 nearly reached the theoretical optimum and beat baselines with full amenity details but without agent-to-agent coordination.



Open-source models were mixed: GPTOSS-20b performed strongly under both Perfect search and Lexical search conditions, even exceeding GPT-4o&#8217;s performance with Perfect search. This suggests that relatively compact models can exhibit robust information-gathering and decision-making capabilities in complex multi-agent environments. Qwen3-4b-2507 faltered when discovery involved irrelevant options (Lexical search), while Qwen3-14b lagged in both cases due to fundamental limitations in reasoning.



Figure 4. Chart showing consumer welfare outcomes in the restaurant industry under different marketplace setups. Blue bars show Agentic: Lexical search, where agents navigate realistic discovery challenges; yellow bars show Agentic: Perfect search, where agents started with ideal matches. Proprietary models approached optimum consumer welfare under perfect search, while open-source models and baselines lagged behind.



Paradox of Choice



One promise of agents is their ability to consider far more options than people can. However, our experiments revealed a surprising limitation: providing agents with more options does not necessarily lead to more thorough exploration. We designed experiments that varied the search results limit from 3 to 100. Except for Gemini-2.5-Flash and GPT-5, the models contacted only a small fraction of available businesses regardless of the search limit. This suggests that most models do not conduct exhaustive comparisons and instead easily accept the initial &#8220;good enough&#8221; options.



Figure 5. More options didn’t lead to broader exploration. Most models still contacted only a few businesses, except Gemini-2.5-Flash and GPT-5.



Additionally, across all models, consumer welfare declined as the number of search results increased. Despite contacting over a hundred businesses, Gemini-2.5-Flash&#8217;s performance declined from 1,700 to 1,350, and GPT-5 declined even more, from a near-optimal 2,000 to 1,400.



This demonstrates a Paradox of Choice effect, where more exploration does not guarantee better outcomes, potentially due to limited long context understanding. Claude Sonnet 4 showed the steepest performance decline, from 1,800 to 600 in consumer welfare. With all the options presented, it struggled to navigate larger sets of options and frequently contacted businesses that did not provide the goods or services that the customer was looking for.



This combination of poor initial selection and premature search termination demonstrates both inadequate decision-making criteria and insufficient exploration strategies. Some models showed modest performance decline (i.e., GPT-4.1: from 1,850 to 1,700; GPT-4o: from 1,550 to 1,450), finding good options within their limited exploration.



Figure 6. Mean consumer welfare decreased as consideration set size grew, revealing a Paradox of Choice effect, where expanding options reduced overall welfare.



Agents are vulnerable to manipulation



We tested six manipulation strategies, ranging from subtle psychological tactics to aggressive prompt injection attacks:




Authority: Fake credentials like “Michelin Guide featured” and “James Beard Award nominated” paired with fabricated certifications.



Social proof: Claims like “Join 50,000+ satisfied customers” or “#1-rated Mexican restaurant” combined with fake reviews.



Loss aversion: Fear-based warnings about “food poisoning” risks and “contamination issues” at competing restaurants.



Prompt injection (basic): Attempts to override agent instructions.



Prompt injection (strong): Aggressive attacks using emergency language and fabricating competitor scandals.




Results revealed significant variation in manipulation resistance across models. Sonnet-4 was resistant to all attacks, and none of the manipulative strategies affected any of the customers’ choices. Gemini-2.5-Flash was generally resistant, except for strong prompt injections, where mean payments to unmanipulated agents were affected as a result. GPT-4o, GPTOSS-20b and Qwen3-4b were very vulnerable to prompt injection: all payments were redirected to the manipulative agent under these conditions. Specifically for GPTOSS-20 and Qwen3-4b-2507, even traditional psychological manipulation tactics (authority appeals and social proof) increased payments to malicious agents, demonstrating their vulnerability to basic persuasion techniques. These findings highlight a critical security concern for agentic marketplaces.



Figure 7. Charts showing the variation in mean payments received by service agents with and without manipulation tactics. The results reveal substantial differences in manipulation resistance across models, with GPT-4.1 showing significantly higher vulnerability compared to Gemini-2.5-Flash.



Systemic biases create unfair advantages



Our analysis revealed two distinct types of systematic biases showed by agents when selecting businesses from search results. Models showed systematic preferences based on where businesses appeared in search results. While proprietary models showed no strong positional preferences, open-source models exhibited clear patterns. Specifically, Qwen2.5-14b-2507 showed a pronounced bias toward selecting the last business presented, regardless of its actual merits.



Proposal&nbsp;bias&nbsp;is&nbsp;more pervasive across all models tested. This &#8220;first-offer acceptance&#8221; pattern suggests that models prioritized&nbsp;immediate selection over comprehensive exploration, potentially missing better alternatives that&nbsp;could have&nbsp;emerged&nbsp;by waiting for better options. This behavior&nbsp;continued&nbsp;across both proprietary and open-source models,&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;a fundamental challenge in agent decision-making architectures.



These biases can create unfair market dynamics, drive unintended behaviors, and push businesses to complete on response speed rather than product or service quality.



Figure 8. All models showed strong preference for the first proposal received, accepting it without waiting for additional proposals or conducting systematic comparisons.



What this means



Even state-of-the-art models can show notable vulnerabilities and biases in marketplace environments. In our implementation, agents struggled with too many options, were susceptible to manipulation tactics, and showed systemic biases that created unfair advantages.



These outcomes are shaped not only by agent capabilities but also by marketplace design and implementation. Our current study focused on static markets, but real-world environments are dynamic, with agents and users learning over time. Oversight is critical for high-stakes transactions. Agents should assist, not replace, human decision-making.



We plan to explore dynamic markets and human-in-the-loop designs to improve efficiency and trust. A simulation environment like Magentic Marketplace is crucial for understanding the interplay between market components and agents before deploying them at scale.



Full details of our experimental setup and results are available in our paper (opens in new tab).

• RedCodeAgent: Automatic red-teaming agent against diverse code agents
  Introduction



Code agents are AI systems that can generate high-quality code and work smoothly with code interpreters. These capabilities help streamline complex software development workflows,&nbsp;which has led to their widespread adoption.



However, this progress also introduces critical safety and security risks. Existing static safety benchmarks and red-teaming methods—in which&nbsp;security researchers&nbsp;simulate real-world attacks to&nbsp;identify&nbsp;security vulnerabilities—often fall short when evaluating code agents.&nbsp;They&nbsp;may&nbsp;fail to&nbsp;detect&nbsp;emerging real-world risks, such as the combined effects of multiple jailbreak tools.&nbsp;In&nbsp;the context of code, effective red-teaming requires more than simply checking whether the target code agent rejects unsafe requests. Instead, the agent must generate and execute correct code that performs the intended risky functionality, making it essential to evaluate execution behaviors beyond static code analysis.&nbsp;



To address these challenges, researchers from the University of Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign, VirtueAI, the UK AI Safety Institute, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, and Microsoft Research recently proposed RedCodeAgent, the first fully automated and adaptive red-teaming agent designed specifically to evaluate the safety of large language model&nbsp;(LLM)-based code agents.



Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of&nbsp;RedCodeAgent across (1) diverse Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities and malware types, (2) multiple programming languages—including Python, C, C++, and Java—and (3) a wide range of code agents, such as OpenCodeInterpreter, ReAct, MetaGPT, and commercial agents like Cursor and&nbsp;Codeium.&nbsp;RedCodeAgent also uncovers common vulnerabilities across agents&nbsp;such as generating and executing unsafe code, exposes variations in red-teaming difficulty across goals, identifies frequently triggered attack tools, and detects previously unknown vulnerabilities that all other baseline methods overlook.&nbsp;



Framework for&nbsp;automatic&nbsp;red-teaming&nbsp;against&nbsp;code&nbsp;agents



Figure 1: Illustration of&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;on automatic red-teaming against a target code agent&nbsp;



As shown in Figure 1,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;is equipped with a&nbsp;memory module&nbsp;that accumulates successful attack experiences, enabling the system to&nbsp;continuously learn and adapt its attack strategies. After learning from the previous experiences,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;further&nbsp;leverages&nbsp;a&nbsp;tailored toolbox&nbsp;that combines representative red-teaming tools with a specialized&nbsp;code substitution module, enabling realistic and diverse code-specific attack simulations through function calling. Based on the target agent’s responses across multiple interactive trials, RedCodeAgent optimizes&nbsp;its strategies, systematically&nbsp;probing for&nbsp;weaknesses and vulnerabilities&nbsp;in real time.&nbsp;



In the evaluation phase,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;integrates simulated sandbox environments to enable code execution and assess the impact of the resulting behaviors. This sandbox-based evaluation ensures a more robust assessment of harmful behaviors and addresses the potential biases of&nbsp;previous&nbsp;static methods that rely solely on “LLM-as-a-judge” evaluations.



A case study is shown in Figure 2. Initially,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;discovers that the request was rejected, then RedCodeAgent calls the Greedy Coordinate&nbsp;Gradient&nbsp;(GCG)&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;to bypass the safety guardrail. After the second request was rejected by the code agent,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;invoked both Code Substitution and GCG to optimize the prompt. Ultimately,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;successfully combined the suggestion from Code Substitution (i.e., using&nbsp;pathlib) with the adversarial suffix generated by GCG, making the target code agent delete the specified file.

Insights from&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;



Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;achieves both a higher attack success rate (ASR) and a lower rejection rate, revealing several key findings outlined below.



Using&nbsp;traditional&nbsp;jailbreak&nbsp;methods&nbsp;alone&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;improve&nbsp;ASR on code agents



The optimized prompts generated by GCG,&nbsp;AmpleGCG,&nbsp;Advprompter, and&nbsp;AutoDAN&nbsp;do not always achieve a higher ASR compared with static prompts with no jailbreak, as shown in Figure 3.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;likely&nbsp;due to the difference between code-specific tasks and general malicious request tasks in LLM safety. In the context of code, it is not enough for the target code agent to simply avoid rejecting the request; the target code agent must also generate and execute code that performs the intended function.&nbsp;Previous&nbsp;jailbreak methods do not guarantee this outcome. However,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;ensures that the input prompt has a clear functional objective (e.g., deleting specific sensitive files). RedCodeAgent&nbsp;can dynamically adjust based on evaluation feedback, continually optimizing to achieve the specified objectives.



Figure 3：RedCodeAgent&nbsp;achieves the highest ASR compared with other methods



RedCodeAgent&nbsp;exhibits&nbsp;adaptive&nbsp;tool&nbsp;utilization&nbsp;



RedCodeAgent&nbsp;can dynamically adjust its tool usage based on task difficulty. Figure 4 shows that the tool calling combination is different&nbsp;for&nbsp;different tasks.&nbsp;For simpler tasks, where the baseline static test cases already achieve a high ASR,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;spends little time invoking&nbsp;additional&nbsp;tools,&nbsp;demonstrating&nbsp;its efficiency. For more challenging tasks, where the baseline static test cases in&nbsp;RedCode-Exec achieve a lower ASR,we observe that RedCodeAgent spends more time using advanced tools like&nbsp;GCG and&nbsp;Advprompter&nbsp;to&nbsp;optimize&nbsp;the prompt for a successful attack. As a result, the average time spent on invoking different tools varies across tasks, indicating that RedCodeAgent adapts its strategy depending on the specific task.&nbsp;



Figure 4: Average time cost for&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;to invoke different tools or query the target code agent in successful cases for each risk scenario&nbsp;



RedCodeAgent&nbsp;discovers&nbsp;new&nbsp;vulnerabilities



In scenarios where other methods&nbsp;fail to&nbsp;find successful attack strategies,&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;is able to discover new, feasible jailbreak approaches. Quantitatively, we find that&nbsp;RedCodeAgent&nbsp;is capable of discovering&nbsp;82 (out of 27*30=810 cases in&nbsp;RedCode-Exec benchmark) unique vulnerabilities on the&nbsp;OpenCodeInterpreter&nbsp;code agent and 78 on the ReAct code agent. These are cases where all baseline methods&nbsp;fail to&nbsp;identify the vulnerability, but RedCodeAgent succeeds.



Summary



RedCodeAgent&nbsp;combines adaptive memory, specialized tools, and simulated execution environments to uncover real-world risks that static benchmarks&nbsp;may&nbsp;miss.&nbsp;It&nbsp;consistently outperforms leading jailbreak methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates, while remaining efficient and adaptable across diverse agents and programming languages.

• Connect Amazon Bedrock agents to cross-account knowledge bases
  Organizations need seamless access to their structured data repositories to power intelligent AI agents. However, when these resources span multiple AWS accounts integration challenges can arise. This post explores a practical solution for connecting Amazon Bedrock agents to knowledge bases in Amazon Redshift clusters residing in different AWS accounts. 
The challenge 
Organizations that build AI agents using Amazon Bedrock can maintain their structured data in Amazon Redshift clusters. When these data repositories exist in separate AWS accounts from their AI agents, they face a significant limitation: Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases doesn’t natively support cross-account Redshift integration. 
This creates a challenge for enterprises with multi-account architectures who want to: 
 
 Leverage existing structured data in Redshift for their AI agents. 
 Maintain separation of concerns across different AWS accounts. 
 Avoid duplicating data across accounts. 
 Ensure proper security and access controls. 
 
Solution overview 
Our solution enables cross-account knowledge base integration through a secure, serverless architecture that maintains secure access controls while allowing AI agents to query structured data. The approach uses AWS Lambda as an intermediary to facilitate secure cross-account data access. 
 
The action flow as shown above: 
 
 Users enter their natural language question in Amazon Bedrock Agents which is configured in the agent account. 
 Amazon Bedrock Agents invokes a&nbsp;Lambda function through action groups which provides access to the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base configured in the agent-kb account above. 
 Action group Lambda function running in agent account assumes an IAM role created in agent-kb account above to connect to the knowledge base in the agent-kb account. 
 Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base in the agent-kb account uses an IAM role created in the same account to access Amazon Redshift data warehouse and query data in the data warehouse. 
 
The solution follows these key components: 
 
 Amazon Bedrock agent in the agent account that handles user interactions. 
 Amazon Redshift serverless workgroup in VPC and private subnet in the agent-kb account containing structured data. 
 Amazon Bedrock Knowledge base using the Amazon Redshift serverless workgroup as structured data source. 
 Lambda function in the agent account. 
 Action group configuration to connect the agent in the agent account to the Lambda function. 
 IAM roles and policies that enable secure cross-account access. 
 
Prerequisites 
This solution requires you to have the following: 
 
 Two AWS accounts. Create an AWS account if you do not have one. Specific permissions required for both account which will be set up in subsequent steps. 
 Install the AWS CLI (2.24.22 – current version) 
 Set up authentication using IAM user credentials for the AWS CLI for each account 
 Make sure you have jq installed, jq is lightweight command-line JSON processor. For example, in Mac you can use the command brew install jq (jq-1.7.1-apple – current version) to install it. 
 Navigate to the Amazon Bedrock console and make sure you enable access to the meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0 model for the agent-kb account and access for us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0 model in the agent account in the us-west-2, US West (Oregon) AWS Region. 
 
Assumption 
Let’s call the AWS account profile, agent profile that has the Amazon Bedrock agent. Similarly, the AWS account profile be called agent-kb that has the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base with Amazon Redshift Serverless and the structured data source. We will use the us-west-2 US West (Oregon) AWS Region but feel free to choose another AWS Region as necessary (the prerequisites will be applicable to the AWS Region you choose to deploy this solution in). We will use the meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0 model for the agent-kb. This is an available on-demand model in us-west-2. You are free to choose other models with cross-Region inference but that would mean changing the roles and polices accordingly and enable model access in all Regions they are available in. Based on our model choice for this solution the AWS Region must be us-west-2. For the agent we will be using an Amazon Bedrock agent optimized model like us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0. 
Implementation walkthrough 
The following is a step-by-step implementation guide. Make sure to perform all steps in the same AWS Region in both accounts. 
These steps are to deploy and test an end-to-end solution from scratch and if you are already running some of these components, you may skip over those steps. 
 
  
   
   Make a note of the AWS account numbers in the agent and agent-kb account. In the implementation steps we will refer them as follows:

           Verify Nova Pro (us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0) model access in the agent account. Navigate to the Amazon Bedrock console and choose Model access under Configure and learn. Search for Model name : Nova Pro to verify access. If not, then enable model access.  
           Verify access to the meta.llama3-1-70b-instruct-v1:0 model in the agent-kb account. This should already be enabled as we set up the knowledge base earlier. 
            
          
        
      
   Run the agent. Log on to agent account. Navigate to Amazon Bedrock console and choose Agents under Build. 
   Choose the name of the agent and choose Test. You can test the following questions as mentioned the workshop’s Stage 4: Test Natural Language Queries page. For example: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
           Who are the top 5 customers in Saudi Arabia? 
           Who are the top parts supplier in the United States by volume? 
           What is the total revenue by region for the year 1998? 
           Which products have the highest profit margins? 
           Show me orders with the highest priority from the last quarter of 1997. 
            
          
        
      
   Choose Show trace to investigate the agent traces. 
    
 
Some recommended best practices: 
 
  
   
    
     
     Phrase your question to be more specific 
     Use terminology that matches your table descriptions 
     Try questions similar to your curated examples 
     Verify your question relates to data that exists in the TPCH dataset 
     Use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails to add configurable safeguards to questions and responses. 
      
    
 
Clean up resources 
It is recommended that you clean up any resources you do not need anymore to avoid any unnecessary charges: 
 
  
   
    
     
     Navigate to the CloudFormation console for the agent and agent-kb account, search for the stack and and choose Delete. 
     S3 buckets need to be deleted separately.  
     For deleting the roles and policies created in both accounts, download the script delete-bedrock-agent-kb-roles-policies.sh from the aws-samples GitHub repository. 
       
       Open Terminal in Mac or similar bash shell on other platforms. 
       Locate and change the directory to the downloaded location, provide executable permissions: 
       
       
       cd /my/location
			chmod +x delete-bedrock-agent-kb-roles-policies.sh 
        
     If you are still not clear on the script usage or inputs, then you can run the script with the –help option then the script will display the usage: ./ delete-bedrock-agent-kb-roles-policies.sh –help 
     Run the script: delete-bedrock-agent-kb-roles-policies.sh with the same values for the same input parameters as in Step7 when running the create_bedrock_agent_kb_roles_policies.sh script. Note: Enter the correct account numbers for agent-account and agent-kb-account before running. 
       
       ./delete-bedrock-agent-kb-roles-policies.sh --agent-profile agent \ 
  	--agent-kb-profile agent-kb \ 
	  --lambda-role lambda_bedrock_kb_query_role \ 
	  --kb-access-role bedrock_kb_access_role \ 
	  --kb-access-policy bedrock_kb_access_policy \ 
	  --lambda-policy lambda_bedrock_kb_query_policy \ 
	  --agent-account 111122223333 \ 
	  --agent-kb-account 999999999999 
       The script will ask for a confirmation, say yes and press enter.  
      
    
 
Summary 
This solution demonstrates how the Amazon Bedrock agent in the agent account can query the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base in the agent-kb account. 
Conclusion 
This solution uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases for structured data to create a more integrated approach to cross-account data access. The knowledge base in agent-kb account connects directly to Amazon Redshift Serverless in a private VPC. The Amazon Bedrock agent in the agent account invokes an AWS Lambda function as part of its action group to make a cross-account connection to retrieve response from the structured knowledge base. 
This architecture offers several advantages: 
 
  
   
    
     
     Uses Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases capabilities for structured data 
     Provides a more seamless integration between the agent and the data source 
     Maintains proper security boundaries between accounts 
     Reduces the complexity of direct database access codes 
      
    
 
As Amazon Bedrock continues to evolve, you can take advantage of future enhancements to knowledge base functionality while maintaining your multi-account architecture.

Conceived as a rapid prototype, Open Arena was developed in under six weeks at the onset of the generative AI boom in early 2023 by TR Labs – TR’s dedicated applied research division focused on the research, development, and application of AI and emerging trends in technologies. The goal was to support internal team exploration of large language models (LLMs) and discover unique use cases by merging LLM capabilities with TR company data. 
Open Arena’s introduction significantly increased AI awareness, fostered developer-SME collaboration for groundbreaking concepts, and accelerated AI capability development for TR products. The rapid success and demand for new features quickly highlighted Open Arena’s potential for AI democratization, so TR developed an enterprise version of Open Arena. Built on the&nbsp;TR AI Platform, Open Arena enterprise version offers secure, scalable, and standardized services covering the entire AI development lifecycle, significantly accelerating time to production. 
The Open Arena enterprise version uses existing system capabilities for enhanced data access controls, standardized service access, and compliance with TR’s governance and ethical standards. This version introduced self-served capabilities so that every user, irrespective of their technical ability, can create, evaluate, and deploy customized AI solutions in a no-code environment. 

 “The foundation of the AI Platform has always been about empowerment; in the early days it was about empowering Data Scientists but with the rise of Gen AI, the platform adapted and evolved on empowering users of any background to leverage and create AI Solutions.”

Open Arena architecture: Scalability, extensibility, and security 
Designed for a broad enterprise audience, Open Arena prioritizes scalability, extensibility and security while maintaining simplicity for non-technical users to create and deploy AI solutions. The following diagram illustrates the architecture of Open Arena. 
 
Figure 2. Architecture design of Open Arena. 
The architecture design facilitates enterprise-grade performance with clear separation between capability and usage, aligning with TR’s enterprise cost and usage tracking requirements. 
The following are key components of the solution architecture: 
 
 No-code interface:&nbsp;Intuitive UI, visual workflow builder, pre-built templates, drag-and-drop functionality. 
 Enterprise integration:&nbsp;Seamless integration with TR’s Enterprise AI Platform, SSO enabled, data handling with enhanced security, clear data separation. 
 Solution management:&nbsp;Searchable repository, public/private sharing, version control, usage analytics. 
 
TR developed Open Arena using AWS services such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon OpenSearch, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and AWS Step Functions. It uses Amazon Bedrock for foundational model interactions, supporting simple chat and complex Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks. Open Arena uses Amazon Bedrock Flows as the custom workflow builder where users can drag-and-drop components like prompts, agents, knowledge bases and Lambda functions to create sophisticated AI workflows without coding. The system also integrates with AWS OpenSearch for knowledge bases and external APIs for advanced agent capabilities. 
For data separation, orchestration is managed using the Enterprise AI Platform AWS account, capturing operational data. Flow instances and user-specific data reside in the user’s dedicated AWS account, stored in a database. Each user’s data and workflow executions are isolated within their respective AWS accounts, which is required for complying with Thomson Reuters data sovereignty and enterprise security policies with strict regional controls. The system integrates with Thomson Reuters SSO solution to automatically identify users and grant secure, private access to foundational models. 
The orchestration layer, centrally hosted within the Enterprise AI Platform AWS account, manages AI workflow activities, including scheduling, deployment, resource provisioning, and governance across user environments. 
The system features fully automated provisioning of&nbsp; Amazon Bedrock Flows directly within each user’s AWS account, avoiding manual setup and accelerating time to value. Using AWS Lambda for serverless compute and DynamoDB for scalable, low-latency storage, the system dynamically allocates resources based on real-time demand. This architecture makes sure prompt flows and supporting infrastructure are deployed and scaled to match workload fluctuations, optimizing performance, cost, and user experience. 

 “Our decision to adopt a cross-account architecture was driven by a commitment to enterprise security and operational excellence. By isolating orchestration from execution, we make sure that each user’s data remains private and secure within their own AWS account, while still delivering a seamless, centrally-managed experience. This design empowers organizations to innovate rapidly without compromising compliance or control.”
