• Meet Jim O’Neill, the longevity enthusiast who is now RFK Jr.’s right-hand man
  When Jim O’Neill was nominated to be the second in command at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dylan Livingston was excited. As founder and CEO of the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI), Livingston is a member of a community that seeks to extend human lifespan. O’Neill is “kind of one of us,” he told me shortly before O’Neill was sworn in as deputy secretary on June 9. “And now [he’s] in a position of great influence.”



As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s new right-hand man, O’Neill is expected to wield authority at health agencies that fund biomedical research and oversee the regulation of new drugs. And while O’Neill doesn’t subscribe to Kennedy’s most contentious beliefs—and supports existing vaccine schedules—he may still steer the agencies in controversial new directions.&nbsp;





Although much less of a public figure than his new boss, O’Neill is quite well-known in the increasingly well-funded and tight-knit longevity community. His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who describes him as “a soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,” and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel.&nbsp;



In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O’Neill, it’s clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O’Neill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs.&nbsp;



This idea is bolstered not just by his personal and professional relationships but also by his past statements and history working at aging-focused organizations—all of which suggest he indeed believes scientists should be working on ways to extend human lifespan beyond its current limits and thinks unproven therapies should be easier to access. He has also supported the libertarian idea of creating new geographic zones, possibly at sea, in which residents can live by their own rules (including, notably, permissive regulatory regimes for new drugs and therapies).&nbsp;



“In [the last three administrations] there weren’t really people like that from our field taking these positions of power,” says Livingston, adding that O’Neill’s elevation is “definitely something to be excited about.”



Not everyone working in health is as enthusiastic. If O’Neill still holds the views he has espoused over the years, that’s “worrisome,” says Diana Zuckerman, a health policy analyst and president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC.&nbsp;



“There’s nothing worse than getting a bunch of [early-stage unproven therapies] on the market,” she says. Those products might be dangerous and could make people sick while enriching those who develop or sell them.&nbsp;



“Getting things on the market quickly means that everybody becomes a guinea pig,” Zuckerman says. “That’s not the way those of us who care about health care think.”&nbsp;



The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen puts it far more bluntly, describing O’Neill as “one of Trump’s worst picks” and saying that he is “unfit to be the #2 US health-care leader.” His libertarian views are “antithetical to basic public health,” the organization’s co-president said in a statement. Neither O’Neill nor HHS responded to requests for comment.&nbsp;



“One of us”



As deputy secretary of HHS, O’Neill will oversee a number of agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the world’s biggest funder of biomedical research; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country’s public health agency; and the Food and Drug Administration, which was created to ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective.&nbsp;



“It can be a quite powerful position,” says Patricia Zettler, a legal scholar at Ohio State University who specializes in drug regulation and the FDA.





It is the most senior role O’Neill has held at HHS, though it’s not the first. He occupied various positions in the department over five years during the early 2000s, according to his LinkedIn profile. But it is what he did after that has helped him cultivate a reputation as an ally for longevity enthusiasts. 



O’Neill appears to have had a close relationship with Thiel since at least the late 2000s. Thiel has heavily invested in longevity research and has said he does not believe that death is inevitable. In 2011 O’Neill referred to Thiel as his “friend and patron.” (A representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.)&nbsp;



O’Neill also served as CEO of the Thiel Foundation between 2009 and 2012 and cofounded the Thiel Fellowship, which offers $200,000 to promising young people if they drop out of college and do other work. And he spent seven years as managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a “family of long-term venture capital funds” founded by Thiel, according to O’Neill’s LinkedIn profile.&nbsp;



O’Neill got further stitched into the longevity field when he spent more than a decade representing Thiel’s interests as a board member of the SENS Research Foundation (SRF), an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, to which Thiel was a significant donor.&nbsp;



O’Neill even spent a couple of years as CEO of SRF, from 2019 to 2021, when its founder Aubrey de Grey, a prominent figure in the longevity field, was removed following accusations of sexual harassment. As CEO, O’Neill oversaw a student education program and multiple scientific research projects that focused on various aspects of aging, according to the organization’s annual reports. And in a 2020 SRF annual report, O’Neill wrote that Eric Hargan, then the deputy secretary of HHS, had attended an SRF conference to discuss “regulatory reform.” 



“More and more influential people consider aging an absurdity,” he wrote in the report. “Now we need to make it one.”&nbsp;



While de Grey calls him “the devil incarnate”—probably because he believes O’Neill “incited” two women to make sexual harassment allegations against him—the many other scientists, biotech CEOs, and other figures in the longevity field contacted by MIT Technology Review had more positive opinions of O’Neill, with many claiming they were longtime friends or acquaintances of the new deputy secretary (though, at the same time, many were reluctant to share specific views about his past work).&nbsp;



Longevity science is a field that’s long courted controversy, owing largely to far-fetched promises of immortality and the ongoing marketing of creams, pills, intravenous infusions, and other so-called anti-aging treatments that are not supported by evidence. But the community includes people along a spectrum of beliefs (with the goals of adding a few years of healthy lifespan to the population at one end and immortality at the other), and serious doctors and scientists are working to bring legitimacy to the field.&nbsp;



Pretty much everyone in the field that I spoke with appears to be hopeful about what O’Neill will do now that he’s been confirmed. Namely, they hope he will use his new position to direct attention and funds to legitimate longevity research and the development of new drugs that might slow or reverse human aging.&nbsp;





Johnson, whose extreme and expensive approaches to extending his own lifespan have made him something of a celebrity, calls O’Neill a friend and says they’ve “known each other for a little over 15 years.” He says he can imagine O’Neill setting a goal to extend the lifespans of Americans.



Eric Verdin, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, says O’Neill has “been at the Buck several times” and calls him “a good guy”—someone who is “serious” and who understands the science of aging. He says, “He’s certainly someone who is going to help us to really bring the longevity field to the front of the priorities of this administration.”



Celine Halioua, CEO of the biotech company Loyal, which is developing drugs to extend the lifespan of dogs, echoes these sentiments, saying she has “always liked and respected” O’Neill. “It’ll definitely be nice to have somebody who’s bought into the thesis [of longevity science] at the FDA,” she says.&nbsp;



And Joe Betts-LaCroix, CEO of the longevity biotech company Retro Biosciences, says he’s known O’Neill for something like 10 years and describes him as “smart and clear thinking.” “We’ve mutually been part of poetry readings,” he says. “He’s been definitely interested in wanting us as a society to make progress on age-related disease.”



After his confirmation, the A4LI LinkedIn account posted a photo of Livingston, its CEO, with O’Neill, writing that “we look forward to working with him to elevate aging research as a national priority and to modernize regulatory pathways that support the development of longevity medicines.”



“His work at SENS Research Foundation [suggests] to me and to others that [longevity] is going to be something that he prioritizes,” Livingston says. “I think he’s a supporter of this field, and that’s really all that matters right now to us.”



Changing the rules



While plenty of treatments have been shown to slow aging in lab animals, none of them have been found to successfully slow or reverse human aging. And many longevity enthusiasts believe drug regulations are to blame.&nbsp;



O’Neill is one of them. He has long supported deregulation of new drugs and medical devices. During his first tour at HHS, for instance, he pushed back against regulations on the use of algorithms in medical devices. “FDA had to argue that an algorithm … is a medical device,” he said in a 2014 presentation at a meeting on “rejuvenation biotechnology.” “I managed to put a stop to that, at least while I was there.”



During the same presentation, O’Neill advocated lowering the bar for drug approvals in the US. “We should reform [the] FDA so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them at their own risk,” he said. “Let’s prove efficacy after they’ve been legalized.”





This sentiment appears to be shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a recent podcast interview with Gary Brecka, who describes himself as a “longevity expert,” Kennedy said that he wanted to expand access to experimental therapies. “If you want to take an experimental drug … you ought to be able to do that,” he said in the episode, which was published online in May.



But the idea is divisive. O’Neill was essentially suggesting that drugs be made available after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don’t reveal whether the drug actually works.



That’s an idea that concerns ethicists. “It’s just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that’s responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they&#8217;re made available to patients couldn’t protect patients from charlatans,” says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who is currently on sabbatical. “It’s just like a complete dereliction of duty.”



Robert Steinbrook, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, largely agrees that this kind of change to the drug approval process is a bad idea, though notes that he and his colleagues are generally more concerned about O’Neill’s views on the regulation of technologies like AI in health care, given his previous efforts on algorithms.&nbsp;



“He has deregulatory views and would not be an advocate for an appropriate amount of regulation when regulation was needed,” Steinbrook says.



Ultimately, though, even if O’Neill does try to change things, Zettler points out that there is currently no lawful way for the FDA to approve drugs that aren’t shown to be effective. That requirement won’t change unless Congress acts on the matter, she says: “It remains to be seen how big of a role HHS leadership will have in FDA policy on that front.”&nbsp;



A longevity state



A major goal for a subset of longevity enthusiasts relates to another controversial idea: creating new geographic zones in which people can live by their own rules. The goal has taken various forms, including “network states” (which could start out as online social networks and evolve into territories that make use of cryptocurrency), “special economic zones,” and more recently “freedom cities.”&nbsp;



While specific details vary, the fundamental concept is creating a new society, beyond the limits of nations and governments, as a place to experiment with new approaches to rules and regulations.&nbsp;



In 2023, for instance, a group of longevity enthusiasts met at a temporary “pop-up city” in Montenegro to discuss plans to establish a “longevity state”—a geographic zone with a focus on extending human lifespan. Such a zone might encourage healthy behaviors and longevity research, as well as a fast-tracked system to approve promising-looking longevity drugs. They considered Rhode Island as the site but later changed their minds.





Some of those same longevity enthusiasts have set up shop in Próspera, Honduras—a “special economic zone” on the island of Roatán with a libertarian approach to governance, where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Another pop-up city, Vitalia, was set up there for two months in 2024, complete with its own biohacking lab; it also happened to be in close proximity to an established clinic selling an unproven longevity “gene therapy” for around $20,000. The people behind Vitalia referred to it as “a Los Alamos for longevity.” Another new project, Infinita City, is now underway in the former Vitalia location.



O’Neill has voiced support for this broad concept, too. He’s posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, writing “Get government out of the way” and, in reference to bills to shrink what some politicians see as government overreach, “No reason to wait.” And more to the point, he wrote on X last November, “Build freedom cities,” reposting another message that said: “I love the idea and think we should put the first one on the former Alameda Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Bay.”&nbsp;



And up until March of last year, according to his financial disclosures, he served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute, an organization with the goal of creating “startup countries” at sea. “We are also negotiating with countries to establish a SeaZone (a specially designed economic zone where seasteading companies could build their platforms),” the organization explains on its website.



“The healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea,” O’Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference in 2009. In that presentation, he talked up the benefits of a free market for health care, saying that seasteads could offer improved health care and serve as medical tourism hubs: “The last best hope for freedom is on the sea.”



Some in the longevity community see the ultimate goal as establishing a network state within the US. “That’s essentially what we’re doing in Montana,” says A4LI’s Livingston, referring to his successful lobbying efforts to create a hub for experimental medicine there. Over the last couple of years, the state has expanded Right to Try laws, which were originally designed to allow terminally ill individuals to access unproven treatments. Under new state laws, anyone can access such treatments, providing they have been through an initial phase I trial as a preliminary safety test.



“We’re doing a freedom city in Montana without calling it a freedom city,” says Livingston.



Patri Friedman, the libertarian founder of the Seasteading Institute, who calls O’Neill “a close friend,” explains that part of the idea of freedom cities is to create “specific industry clusters” on federal land in the US and win “regulatory carve-outs” that benefit those industries.&nbsp;



A freedom city for longevity biotech is “being discussed,” says Friedman, although he adds that those discussions are still in the very early stages. He says he’d possibly work with O’Neill on “changing regulations that are under HHS” but isn’t yet certain what that might involve: “We&#8217;re still trying to research and define the whole program and gather support for it.”



Will he deliver?



Some libertarians, including longevity enthusiasts, believe this is their moment to build a new experimental home.&nbsp;



Not only do they expect backing from O’Neill, but they believe President Trump has advocated for new economic zones, perhaps dedicated to the support of specific industries, that can set their own rules for governance.&nbsp;



While campaigning for the presidency in 2023, Trump floated what seemed like a similar idea: “We should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development,” he said in a recorded campaign speech. (The purpose of these new cities was somewhat vague. “These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite the American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people—all hardworking families—a new shot at homeownership and in fact the American dream,” he said.)



But given how frequently Trump changes his mind, it’s hard to tell what the president, and others in the administration, will now support on this front.&nbsp;





And even if HHS does try to create new geographic zones in some form, legal and regulatory experts say this approach won’t necessarily speed up drug development the way some longevity enthusiasts hope.&nbsp;



“The notion around so-called freedom cities, with respect to biomedical innovation, just reflects deep misunderstandings of what drug development entails,” says Ohio State’s Zettler. “It’s not regulatory requirements that [slow down] drug development—it’s the scientific difficulty of assessing safety and effectiveness and of finding true therapies.”



Making matters even murkier, a lot of the research geared toward finding those therapies has been subject to drastic cuts.The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world and has supported major scientific discoveries, including those that benefit longevity research. But in late March, HHS announced a “dramatic restructuring” that would involve laying off 10,000 full-time employees. Since Trump took office, over a thousand NIH research grants have been ended and the administration has announced plans to slash funding for “indirect” research costs—a move that would cost individual research institutions millions of dollars. Research universities (notably Harvard) have been the target of policies to limit or revoke visas for international students, demands to change curricula, and threats to their funding and tax-exempt status.



The NIH also directly supports aging research. Notably, the Interventions Testing Program is a program run by the National Institutes of Aging (a branch of the NIH) to find drugs that make mice live longer. The idea is to understand the biology of aging and find candidates for human longevity drugs.



The ITP has tested around five to seven drugs a year for over 20 years, says Richard Miller, a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan, one of three institutes involved in the program. “We’ve published eight winners so far,” he adds.



The future of the ITP is uncertain, given recent actions of the Trump administration, he says. The cap on indirect costs alone would cost the University of Michigan around $181 million, the university’s interim vice president for research and innovation said in February. The proposals are subject to ongoing legal battles. But in the meantime, morale is low, says Miller. “In the worst-case scenario, all aging research [would be stopped],” he says.



The A4LI has also had to tailor its lobbying strategy given the current administration’s position on government-funded research. Alongside its efforts to change Montana state law to allow clinics to sell unproven treatments, the organization had been planning to push for an all-new NIH institute dedicated to aging and longevity research—an idea that O’Neill voiced support for last year. But current funding cuts under the new administration suggest that it’s “not the ideal political climate for this,” says Livingston.



Despite their enthusiasm for O’Neill’s confirmation, this has all left many members of the longevity community, particularly those with research backgrounds, concerned about what the cuts mean for the future of longevity science.



“Someone like [O’Neill], who’s an advocate for aging and longevity, would be fantastic to have at HHS,” says Matthew O’Connor, who spent over a decade at SRF and says he knows O’Neill “pretty well.” But he adds that “we shouldn’t be cutting the NIH.” Instead, he argues, the agency’s funding should be multiplied by 10.



“The solution to curing diseases isn’t to get rid of the organizations that are there to help us cure diseases,” adds O’Connor, who is currently co-CEO at Cyclarity Therapeutics, a company developing drugs for atherosclerosis and other age-related diseases.&nbsp;



But it’s still just too soon to confidently predict how, if at all, O’Neill will shape the government health agencies he will oversee.&nbsp;



“We don’t know exactly what he’s going to be doing as the deputy secretary of HHS,” says Public Citizen’s Steinbrook. “Like everybody who&#8217;s sworn into a government job, whether we disagree or agree with their views or actions … we still wish them well. And we hope that they do a good job.”
• The Download: how to clean up AI data centers, and weight-loss drugs’ side effects
  This is today&#8217;s edition of The Download, our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology.



This battery recycling company is now cleaning up AI data centers



In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.Redwood Materials, one of the US’s largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.The event marked the launch of the company&#8217;s new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities. Read the full story.—James Temple







We’re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body



Weight-loss drugs are this decade’s blockbuster medicines. Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.

• We’re learning more about what weight-loss drugs do to the body
  Weight-loss drugs are this decade’s blockbuster medicines. Drugs like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro help people with diabetes get their blood sugar under control and help overweight and obese people reach a healthier weight. And they’re fast becoming a trendy must-have for celebrities and other figure-conscious individuals looking to trim down.



They became so hugely popular so quickly that not long after their approval for weight loss, we saw global shortages of the drugs. Prescriptions have soared over the last five years, but even people who don’t have prescriptions are seeking these drugs out online. A 2024 health tracking poll by KFF found that around 1 in 8 US adults said they had taken one.





We know they can suppress appetite, lower blood sugar, and lead to dramatic weight loss. We also know that they come with side effects, which can include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. But we are still learning about some of their other effects.



On the one hand, these seemingly miraculous drugs appear to improve health in other ways, helping to protect against heart failure, kidney disease, and potentially even substance-use disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.



But on the other, they appear to be harmful to some people. Their use has been linked to serious conditions, pregnancy complications, and even some deaths. This week let’s take a look at what weight-loss drugs can do.



Ozempic, Wegovy, and other similar drugs are known as GLP-1 agonists; they mimic a chemical made in the intestine, GLP-1, that increases insulin and lowers blood levels of glucose. Originally developed to treat diabetes, they are now known to be phenomenal at suppressing appetite. One key trial, published in 2015, found that over the course of around a year, people who took one particular drug lost between around 4.7% and 6% of their body weight, depending on the dose they took.



Newer versions of that drug were shown to have even bigger effects. A 2021 trial of semaglutide—the active ingredient in both Ozempic and Wegovy—found that people who took it for 68 weeks lost around 15% of their body weight—equivalent to around 15 kilograms.



But there appear to be other benefits, too. In 2024, an enormous study that included 17,604 people in 41 countries found that semaglutide appeared to reduce heart failure in people who were overweight or obese and had cardiovascular disease. That same year, the US approved Wegovy to “reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and stroke in [overweight] adults with cardiovascular disease.” This year, Ozempic was approved to reduce the risk of kidney disease.



And it doesn’t end there. The many users of GLP-1 agonists have been reporting some unexpected positive side effects. Not only are they less interested in food, but they are less interested in alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and other addictive substances.





Research suggests they might protect men from prostate cancer. They might help treat osteoarthritis. Some scientists think the drugs could be used to treat a range of pain conditions, and potentially help people with migraine. And some even seem to protect brain cells from damage in lab studies, and they are being explored as potential treatments for neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s (although we don’t yet have any evidence they can be useful here).



The more we learn about GLP-1 agonists, the more miraculous they seem to be. What can’t they do?! you might wonder. Unfortunately, like any drug, GLP-1 agonists carry safety warnings. They can often cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea ,and their use has also been linked to inflammation of the pancreas—a condition that can be fatal. They increase the risk of gall bladder disease.



There are other concerns. Weight-loss drugs can help people trim down on fat, but lean muscle can make up around 10% of the body weight lost by people taking them. That muscle is important, especially as we get older. Muscle loss can affect strength and mobility, and it also can also leave people more vulnerable to falls, which are the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.



And, as with most drugs, we don’t fully understand the effects weight-loss drugs might have in pregnancy. That’s important; even though the drugs are not recommended during pregnancy, health agencies point out that some people who take these drugs might be more likely to get pregnant, perhaps because they interfere with the effects of contraceptive drugs.



And we don’t really know how they might affect the development of a fetus, if at all. A study published in January found that people who took the drugs either before or during pregnancy didn’t seem to face increased risk of birth defects. But other research due to be presented at a conference in the coming days found that such individuals were more likely to experience obstetrical complications and preeclampsia.



So yes, while the drugs are incredibly helpful for many people, they are not for everyone. It might be fashionable to be thin, but it’s not necessarily healthy. No drug comes without risks. Even one that 1 in 8 American adults have taken.

• This battery recycling company is now cleaning up AI data centers
  In a sandy industrial lot outside Reno, Nevada, rows of battery packs that once propelled electric vehicles are now powering a small AI data center.



Redwood Materials, one of the US’s largest battery recycling companies, showed off this array of energy storage modules, sitting on cinder blocks and wrapped in waterproof plastic, during a press tour at its headquarters on June 26.&nbsp;



The event marked the launch of the company’s new business line, Redwood Energy, which will initially repurpose (rather than recycle) batteries with years of remaining life to create renewable-powered microgrids. Such small-scale energy systems can operate on or off the larger electricity grid, providing electricity for businesses or communities.



Redwood Materials says many of the batteries it takes in for processing retain more than half their capacity.&nbsp;



“We can extract a lot more value from that material by using it as an energy storage project before recycling it,” JB Straubel, Redwood’s founder and chief executive, said at the event.&nbsp;



This first microgrid, housed at the company’s facility in the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, is powered by solar panels and capable of generating 64 megawatt-hours of electricity, making it one of the nation’s largest such systems. That power flows to Crusoe, a cryptocurrency miner that pivoted into developing AI data centers, which has built a facility with 2,000 graphics processing units adjacent to the lot of repurposed EV batteries.&nbsp;



(That’s tiny as modern data centers go: Crusoe is developing a $500 billion AI data center for OpenAI and others in Abilene, Texas, where it expects to install 100,000 GPUs across its first two facilities by the end of the year, according to Forbes.)



Redwood’s project underscores a growing interest in powering data centers partially or entirely outside the electric grid. Not only would such microgrids be quicker to build than conventional power plants, but consumer ratepayers wouldn’t be on the hook for the cost of new grid-connected power plants developed to serve AI data centers. Since Redwood’s batteries are used, and have already been removed from vehicles, the company says its microgrids should also be substantially cheaper than ones assembled from new batteries.



COURTESY REDWOOD MATERIALS




Redwood Energy’s microgrids could generate electricity for any kind of operation. But the company stresses they’re an ideal fit for addressing the growing energy needs and climate emissions of data centers. The energy consumption of such facilities could double by 2030, mainly due to the ravenous appetite of AI, according to an April report by the International Energy Agency.



“Storage is this perfectly positioned technology, especially low-cost storage, to attack each of those problems,” Straubel says.



The Tahoe Reno Industrial Center is the epicenter of a data center development boom in northern Nevada that has sparked growing concerns about climate emissions and excessive demand for energy and water, as MIT Technology Review recently reported.



Straubel says the litany of data centers emerging around it “would be logical targets” for its new business line, but adds there are growth opportunities across the expanding data center clusters in Texas, Virginia, and the Midwest as well.



“We’re talking to a broad cross section of those companies,” he says.



Crusoe, which also provides cloud services, recently announced a joint venture with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to provide “powered data center real estate solutions” to AI companies by constructing 4.5 gigawatts of new natural-gas plants.



Redwood’s microgrid should provide more than 99% of the electricity Crusoe’s local facilities need. In the event of extended periods with little sunlight, a rarity in the Nevada desert, the company could still draw from the standard power grid.



Cully Cavness, cofounder and operating chief of Crusoe, says the company is already processing AI queries and producing conclusions for its customers at the Nevada facility. (Its larger data centers are dedicated to the more computationally intensive process of training AI models.)



Redwood’s new business division offers a test case for a strategy laid out in a paper late last year, which highlighted the potential for solar-powered microgrids to supply the energy that AI data centers need.



The authors of that paper found that microgrids could be built much faster than natural-gas plants and would generally be only a little more expensive as an energy source for data centers, so long as the facilities could occasionally rely on natural-gas generators to get them through extended periods of low sunlight.



If solar-powered microgrids were used to power 30 gigawatts of new AI data centers, with just 10% backup from natural gas, it would eliminate 400 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions relative to running the centers entirely on natural gas, the study found.&nbsp;



“Having a data center running off solar and storage is more or less what we were advocating for in our paper,” says Zeke Hausfather, climate lead at the payments company Stripe and a coauthor of the paper. He hopes that Redwood’s new microgrid will establish that “these sorts of systems work in the real world” and encourage other data center developers to look for similar solutions. 



Redwood Materials says electric vehicles are its fastest-growing source of used batteries, and it estimates that more than 100,000 EVs will come off US roads this year.



The company says it tests each battery to determine whether it can be reused. Those that qualify will be integrated into its modular storage systems, which can then store up energy from wind and solar installations or connect to the grid. As those batteries reach the end of their life, they’ll be swapped out of the microgrids and moved into the company’s recycling process.&nbsp;



Redwood says it already has enough reusable batteries to build a gigawatt-hour’s worth of microgrids, capable of powering a little more than a million homes for an hour. In addition, the company’s new division has begun designing microgrids that are 10 times larger than the one it unveiled this week.



Straubel expects Redwood Energy to become a major business line, conceivably surpassing the company’s core recycling operation someday.



“We’re confident this is the lowest-cost solution out there,” he says.

Beyond gene-edited babies: the possible paths for tinkering with human evolution



Editing human embryos is restricted in much of the world—and making an edited baby is fully illegal in most countries surveyed by legal scholars. But advancing technology could render the embryo issue moot.



New ways of adding CRISPR, the revolutionary gene editing tool, to the bodies of people already born could let them easily receive changes as well. It’s possible that in 125 years, many people will be the beneficiaries of multiple rare, but useful, gene mutations currently found in only small segments of the population.&nbsp;



These could protect us against common diseases and infections, but eventually they could also yield improvements in other traits, such as height, metabolism, or even cognition. But humanity won’t necessarily do things the right way. Read the full story.

• It’s officially summer, and the grid is stressed
  It’s crunch time for the grid this week. As I’m writing this newsletter, it’s 100 °F (nearly 38 °C) here in New Jersey, and I’m huddled in the smallest room in my apartment with the shades drawn and a single window air conditioner working overtime.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Large swaths of the US have seen brutal heat this week, with multiple days in a row nearing or exceeding record-breaking temperatures. Spain recently went through a dramatic heat wave too, as did the UK, which is unfortunately bracing for another one soon. As I’ve been trying to stay cool, I’ve had my eyes on a website tracking electricity demand, which is also hitting record highs. 





We rely on electricity to keep ourselves comfortable, and more to the point, safe. These are the moments we design the grid for: when need is at its very highest. The key to keeping everything running smoothly during these times might be just a little bit of flexibility.&nbsp;



While heat waves happen all over the world, let’s take my local grid as an example. I’m one of the roughly 65 million people covered by PJM Interconnection, the largest grid operator in the US. PJM covers Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, as well as bits of a couple of neighboring states.



Earlier this year, PJM forecast that electricity demand would peak at 154 gigawatts (GW) this summer. On Monday, just a few days past the official start of the season, the grid blew past that, averaging over 160 GW between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. 



The fact that we’ve already passed both last year’s peak and this year’s forecasted one isn’t necessarily a disaster (PJM says the system’s total capacity is over 179 GW this year). But it is a good reason to be a little nervous. Usually, PJM sees its peak in July or August. As a reminder, it’s June. So we shouldn’t be surprised if we see electricity demand creep to even higher levels later in the summer.



It&#8217;s not just PJM, either. MISO, the grid that covers most of the Midwest and part of the US South, put out a notice that it expected to be close to its peak demand this week. And the US Department of Energy released an emergency order for parts of the Southeast, which allows the local utility to boost generation and skirt air pollution limits while demand is high.



This pattern of maxing out the grid is only going to continue. That’s because climate change is pushing temperatures higher, and electricity demand is simultaneously swelling (in part because of data centers like those that power AI). PJM’s forecasts show that the summer peak in 2035 could reach nearly 210 GW, well beyond the 179 GW it can provide today.&nbsp;



Of course, we need more power plants to be built and connected to the grid in the coming years (at least if we don’t want to keep ancient, inefficient, expensive coal plants running, as we covered last week). But there’s a quiet strategy that could limit the new construction needed: flexibility.



The power grid has to be built for moments of the absolute highest demand we can predict, like this heat wave. But most of the time, a decent chunk of capacity that exists to get us through these peaks sits idle—it only has to come online when demand surges. Another way to look at that, however, is that by shaving off demand during the peak, we can reduce the total infrastructure required to run the grid.&nbsp;



If you live somewhere that’s seen a demand crunch during a heat wave, you might have gotten an email from your utility asking you to hold off on running the dishwasher in the early evening or to set your air conditioner a few degrees higher. These are called demand response programs. Some utilities run more organized programs, where utilities pay customers to ramp down their usage during periods of peak demand.





PJM’s demand response programs add up to almost eight gigawatts of power—enough to power over 6 million homes. With these programs, PJM basically avoids having to fire up the equivalent of multiple massive nuclear power plants. (It did activate these programs on Monday afternoon during the hottest part of the day.)



As electricity demand goes up, building in and automating this sort of flexibility could go a long way to reducing the amount of new generation needed. One report published earlier this year found that if data centers agreed to have their power curtailed for just 0.5% of the time (around 40 hours out of a year of continuous operation), the grid could handle about 18 GW of new power demand in the PJM region without adding generation capacity. 



For the whole US, this level of flexibility would allow the grid to take on an additional 98 gigawatts of new demand without building any new power plants to meet it. To give you a sense of just how significant that would be, all the nuclear reactors in the US add up to 97 gigawatts of capacity.



Tweaking the thermostat and ramping down data centers during hot summer days won’t solve the demand crunch on their own, but it certainly won’t hurt to have more flexibility.

• Google’s new AI will help researchers understand how our genes work
  When scientists first sequenced the human genome in 2003, they revealed the full set of DNA instructions that make a person. But we still didn’t know what all those 3 billion genetic letters actually do. 



Now Google’s DeepMind division says it’s made a leap in trying to understand the code with AlphaGenome, an AI model that predicts what effects small changes in DNA will have on an array of molecular processes, such as whether a gene’s activity will go up or down. It’s just the sort of question biologists regularly assess in lab experiments.



“We have, for the first time, created a single model that unifies many different challenges that come with understanding the genome,” says Pushmeet Kohli, a vice president for research at DeepMind.



Five years ago, the Google AI division released AlphaFold, a technology for predicting the 3D shape of proteins. That work was honored with a Nobel Prize last year and spawned a drug-discovery spinout, Isomorphic Labs, and a boom of companies that hope AI will be able to propose new drugs.



AlphaGenome is an attempt to further smooth biologists’ work by answering basic questions about how changing DNA letters alters gene activity and, eventually, how genetic mutations affect our health.&nbsp;



“We have these 3 billion letters of DNA that make up a human genome, but every person is slightly different, and we don’t fully understand what those differences do,” says Caleb Lareau, a computational biologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center who has had early access to AlphaGenome. “This is the most powerful tool to date to model that.”



Google says AlphaGenome will be free for noncommercial users and plans to release full details of the model in the future. According to Kohli, the company is exploring ways to “enable use of this model by commercial entities” such as biotech companies.&nbsp;





Lareau says AlphaGenome will allow certain types of experiments now done in the lab to be carried out virtually, on a computer. For instance, studies of people who’ve donated their DNA for research often turn up thousands of genetic differences, each slightly raising or lowering the chance a person gets a disease such as Alzheimer’s.



Lareau says DeepMind’s software could be used to quickly make predictions about how each of those variants works at a molecular level, something that would otherwise require time-consuming lab experiments. “You’ll get this list of gene variants, but then I want to understand which of those are actually doing something, and where can I intervene,” he says. “This system pushes us closer to a good first guess about what any variant will be doing when we observe it in a human.”



Don’t expect AlphaGenome to predict very much about individual people, however. It offers&nbsp;clues to nitty-gritty molecular details of gene activity, not 23andMe-type revelations of a person’s traits or ancestry.&nbsp;



“We haven’t designed or validated AlphaGenome for personal genome prediction, a known challenge for AI models,” Google said in a statement.



Underlying the AI system is the so-called transformer architecture invented at Google that also powers large language models like GPT-4. This one was trained on troves of experimental data produced by public scientific projects.



Lareau says the system will not broadly change how his lab works day to day but could permit new types of research. For instance, sometimes doctors encounter patients with ultra-rare cancers, bristling with unfamiliar mutations. AlphaGenome could suggest which of those mutations are really causing the root problem, possibly pointing to a treatment.



“A hallmark of cancer is that specific mutations in DNA make the wrong genes express in the wrong context,” says Julien Gagneur, a professor of computational medicine at the Technical University of Munich. “This type of tool is instrumental in narrowing down which ones mess up proper gene expression.”&nbsp;



The same approach could apply to patients with rare genetic disease, many of whom never learn the source of their condition, even if their DNA has been decoded. “We can obtain their genomes, but we are clueless as to which genetic alterations cause the disease,” says Gagneur. He thinks AlphaGenome could give medical scientists a new way to diagnose such cases.&nbsp;



Eventually, some researchers aspire to use AI to design entire genomes from the ground up and create new life forms. Others think the models will be used to create a fully virtual laboratory for drug studies. “My dream would be to simulate a virtual cell,” Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, said this year.&nbsp;



Kohli calls AlphaGenome a “milestone” on the road to that kind of system. “AlphaGenome may not model the whole cell in its entirety … but it’s starting to sort of shed light on the broader semantics of DNA,” he says.

How Wi-Fi sensing became usable techWi-Fi sensing is a tantalizing concept: that the same routers bringing you the internet could also detect your movements. But, as a way to monitor health, it’s mostly been eclipsed by other technologies, like ultra-wideband radar. 



Despite that, Wi-Fi sensing hasn’t gone away. Instead, it has quietly become available in millions of homes, supported by leading internet service providers, smart-home companies, and chip manufacturers.&nbsp;

• PadChest-GR: A bilingual grounded radiology reporting benchmark for chest X-rays
  In our ever-evolving journey to enhance healthcare through technology, we’re announcing a unique new benchmark for grounded radiology report generation—PadChest-GR (opens in new tab). The world’s first multimodal, bilingual sentence-level radiology report dataset, developed&nbsp;by the University of Alicante with Microsoft Research, University Hospital Sant Joan d’Alacant and MedBravo, is set to redefine how AI and radiologists interpret radiological images. Our work demonstrates how collaboration between humans and AI can create powerful feedback loops—where new datasets drive better AI models, and those models, in turn, inspire richer datasets. We&#8217;re excited to share this progress in NEJM AI, highlighting both the clinical relevance and research excellence of this initiative.&nbsp;



A new frontier in radiology report generation&nbsp;



It is estimated that over half of people visiting hospitals have radiology scans that must be interpreted by a clinical professional. Traditional radiology reports often condense multiple findings into unstructured narratives. In contrast, grounded radiology reporting demands that each finding be described and localized individually.



This can mitigate the risk of AI fabrications and enable new interactive capabilities that enhance clinical and patient interpretability. PadChest-GR is the first bilingual dataset to address this need with 4,555 chest X-ray studies complete with Spanish and English sentence-level descriptions and precise spatial (bounding box) annotations for both positive and negative findings. It is the first public benchmark that enables us to evaluate generation of fully grounded radiology reports in chest X-rays.&nbsp;



Figure 1. Example of a grounded report from PadChest-GR. The original free-text report in Spanish was ”Motivo de consulta: Preoperatorio. Rx PA tórax: Impresión diagnóstica: Ateromatosis aórtica calcificada. Engrosamiento pleural biapical. Atelectasia laminar basal izquierda. Elongación aórtica. Sin otros hallazgos radiológicos significativos.”



This benchmark isn’t standing alone—it plays a critical role in powering our state-of-the-art multimodal report generation model, MAIRA-2. Leveraging the detailed annotations of PadChest-GR, MAIRA-2 represents our commitment to building more interpretable and clinically useful AI systems. You can explore our work on MAIRA-2 on our project web page, including recent user research conducted with clinicians in healthcare settings.



PadChest-GR is a testament to the power of collaboration. Aurelia Bustos at MedBravo and Antonio Pertusa at the University of Alicante published the original&nbsp;PadChest dataset (opens in new tab) in 2020,&nbsp;with the help of Jose María Salinas from Hospital San Juan de Alicante and María de la Iglesia Vayá from the Center of Excellence in Biomedical Imaging at the Ministry of Health in Valencia, Spain. We started to look at PadChest and were deeply impressed by the scale, depth, and diversity of the data.



As we worked more closely with the dataset, we realized the opportunity to develop this for grounded radiology reporting research and worked with the team at the University of Alicante to determine how to approach this together. Our complementary expertise was a nice fit. At Microsoft Research, our mission is to push the boundaries of medical AI through innovative, data-driven solutions. The University of Alicante, with its deep clinical expertise, provided critical insights that greatly enriched the dataset’s relevance and utility. The result of this collaboration is the PadChest-GR dataset.



A significant enabler of our annotation process was Centaur Labs. The team of senior and junior radiologists from the University Hospital Sant Joan d’Alacant, coordinated by Joaquin Galant,&nbsp;used this HIPAA-compliant labeling platform to&nbsp;perform rigorous study-level quality control and bounding box annotations. The annotation protocol implemented ensured that each annotation was accurate and consistent, forming the backbone of a dataset designed for the next generation of grounded radiology report generation models.&nbsp;



Accelerating PadChest-GR dataset annotation with AI&nbsp;



Our approach integrates advanced large language models with comprehensive manual annotation:&nbsp;



Data Selection & Processing: Leveraging Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service (opens in new tab) with GPT-4, we extracted sentences describing individual positive and negative findings from raw radiology reports, translated them from Spanish to English, and linked each sentence to the existing expert labels from PadChest. This was done for a selected subset of the full PadChest dataset, carefully curated to reflect a realistic distribution of clinically relevant findings.&nbsp;



Manual Quality Control & Annotation: The processed studies underwent meticulous quality checks on the Centaur Labs platform by radiologist from Hospital San Juan de Alicante. Each positive finding was then annotated with bounding boxes to capture critical spatial information.&nbsp;



Standardization & Integration: All annotations were harmonized into coherent grounded reports, preserving the structure and context of the original findings while enhancing interpretability.&nbsp;



Figure 2. Overview of the data curation pipeline.



Impact and future directions&nbsp;



PadChest-GR not only sets a new benchmark for grounded radiology reporting, but also serves as the foundation for our MAIRA-2 model, which already showcases the potential of highly interpretable AI in clinical settings. While we developed PadChest-GR to help train and validate our own models, we believe the research community will greatly benefit from this dataset for many years to come. We look forward to seeing the broader research community build on this—improving grounded reporting AI models and using PadChest-GR as a standard for evaluation. We believe that by fostering open collaboration and sharing our resources, we can accelerate progress in medical imaging AI and ultimately improve patient care together with the community.



The collaboration between Microsoft Research and the University of Alicante highlights the transformative power of working together across disciplines. With our publication in NEJM-AI and the integral role of PadChest-GR in the development of MAIRA-2 (opens in new tab) and RadFact (opens in new tab), we are excited about the future of AI-empowered radiology. We invite researchers and industry experts to explore PadChest-GR and MAIRA-2, contribute innovative ideas, and join us in advancing the field of grounded radiology reporting.&nbsp;

• AWS costs estimation using Amazon Q CLI and AWS Cost Analysis MCP
  Managing and optimizing AWS infrastructure costs is a critical challenge for organizations of all sizes. Traditional cost analysis approaches often involve the following: 
 
 Complex spreadsheets – Creating and maintaining detailed cost models, which requires significant effort 
 Multiple tools – Switching between the AWS Pricing Calculator, AWS Cost Explorer, and third-party tools 
 Specialized knowledge – Understanding the nuances of AWS pricing across services and AWS Regions 
 Time-consuming analysis – Manually comparing different deployment options and scenarios 
 Delayed optimization – Cost insights often come too late to inform architectural decisions 
 
Amazon Q Developer CLI with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) offers a revolutionary approach to AWS cost analysis. By using generative AI through natural language prompts, teams can now generate detailed cost estimates, comparisons, and optimization recommendations in minutes rather than hours, while providing accuracy through integration with official AWS pricing data. 
In this post, we explore how to use Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server to perform sophisticated cost analysis that follows AWS best practices. We discuss basic setup and advanced techniques, with detailed examples and step-by-step instructions. 
Solution overview 
Amazon Q Developer CLI is a command line interface that brings the generative AI capabilities of Amazon Q directly to your terminal. Developers can interact with Amazon Q through natural language prompts, making it an invaluable tool for various development tasks. Developed by Anthropic as an open protocol, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources or tools. Using a client-server architecture (as illustrated in the following diagram), the MCP helps developers expose their data through lightweight MCP servers while building AI applications as MCP clients that connect to these servers. 
The MCP uses a client-server architecture containing the following components: 
 
 Host – A program or AI tool that requires access to data through the MCP protocol, such as Anthropic’s Claude Desktop, an integrated development environment (IDE), or other AI applications 
 Client – Protocol clients that maintain one-to-one connections with servers 
 Server – Lightweight programs that expose capabilities through standardized MCP or act as tools 
 Data sources – Local data sources such as databases and file systems, or external systems available over the internet through APIs (web APIs) that MCP servers can connect with 
 
 
As announced in April 2025, the MCP enables Amazon Q Developer to connect with specialized servers that extend its capabilities beyond what’s possible with the base model alone. MCP servers act as plugins for Amazon Q, providing domain-specific knowledge and functionality. The AWS Cost Analysis MCP server specifically enables Amazon Q to generate detailed cost estimates, reports, and optimization recommendations using real-time AWS pricing data. 
Prerequisites 
To implement this solution, you must have an AWS account with appropriate permissions and follow the steps below. 
Set up your environment 
Before you can start analyzing costs, you need to set up your environment with Amazon Q CLI and the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server. This section provides detailed instructions for installation and configuration. 
Install Amazon Q Developer CLI 
Amazon Q Developer CLI is available as a standalone installation. Complete the following steps to install it: 
 
 Download and install Amazon Q Developer CLI. For instructions, see Using Amazon Q Developer on the command line. 
 Verify the installation by running the following command: q --version You should see output similar to the following: Amazon Q Developer CLI version 1.x.x 
 Configure Amazon Q CLI with your AWS credentials: q login 
 Choose the login method suitable for you: 
   
   Use for free with AWS Builder ID 
   Use with Pro license 
    
 
Set up MCP servers 
Before using the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server with Amazon Q CLI, you must install several tools and configure your environment. The following steps guide you through installing the necessary tools and setting up the MCP server configuration: 
 
 Install Panoc using the following command (you can install with brew as well), converting the output to PDF: pip install pandoc 
 Install uv with the following command: pip install uv 
 Install Python 3.10 or newer: uv python install 3.10 
 Add the servers to your ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file: {
  "mcpServers": {
    "awslabs.cost-analysis-mcp-server": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["awslabs.cost-analysis-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL": "ERROR"
      },
      "autoApprove": [],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
 Now, Amazon Q CLI automatically discovers MCP servers in the ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file. 
 
Understanding MCP server tools 
The AWS Cost Analysis MCP server provides several powerful tools: 
 
 get_pricing_from_web – Retrieves pricing information from AWS pricing webpages 
 get_pricing_from_api – Fetches pricing data from the AWS Price List API 
 generate_cost_report – Creates detailed cost analysis reports with breakdowns and visualizations 
 analyze_cdk_project – Analyzes AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) projects to identify services used and estimate costs 
 analyze_terraform_project – Analyzes Terraform projects to identify services used and estimate costs 
 get_bedrock_patterns – Retrieves architecture patterns for Amazon Bedrock with cost considerations 
 
These tools work together to help you create accurate cost estimates that follow AWS best practices. 
Test your setup 
Let’s verify that everything is working correctly by generating a simple cost analysis: 
 
 Start the Amazon Q CLI chat interface and verify the output shows the MCP server being loaded and initialized: q chat 
 In the chat interface, enter the following prompt:Please create a cost analysis for a simple web application with an Application Load Balancer, two t3.medium EC2 instances, and an RDS db.t3.medium MySQL database. Assume 730 hours of usage per month and moderate traffic of about 100 GB data transfer. Convert estimation to a PDF format. 
 Amazon Q CLI will ask for permission to trust the tool that is being used; enter t to trust it. Amazon Q should generate and display a detailed cost analysis. Your output should look like the following screenshot.  If you see the cost analysis report, your environment is set up correctly. If you encounter issues, verify that Amazon Q CLI can access the MCP servers by making sure you installed install the necessary tools and the servers are in the ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file. 
 
Configuration options 
The AWS Cost Analysis MCP server supports several configuration options to customize your cost analysis experience: 
 
 Output format – Choose between markdown, CSV formats, or PDF (which we installed the package for) for cost reports 
 Pricing model – Specify on-demand, reserved instances, or savings plans 
 Assumptions and exclusions – Customize the assumptions and exclusions in your cost analysis 
 Detailed cost data – Provide specific usage patterns for more accurate estimates 
 
Now that our environment is set up, let’s create more cost analyses. 
Create AWS Cost Analysis reports 
In this section, we walk through the process of creating AWS cost analysis reports using Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server. 
When you provide a prompt to Amazon Q CLI, the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server completes the following steps: 
 
 Interpret your requirements. 
 Retrieve pricing data from AWS pricing sources. 
 Generate a detailed cost analysis report. 
 Provide optimization recommendations. 
 
This process happens seamlessly, so you can focus on describing what you want rather than how to create it. 
AWS Cost Analysis reports typically include the following information: 
 
 Service costs – Breakdown of costs by AWS service 
 Unit pricing – Detailed unit pricing information 
 Usage quantities – Estimated usage quantities for each service 
 Calculation details – Step-by-step calculations showing how costs were derived 
 Assumptions – Clearly stated assumptions used in the analysis 
 Exclusions – Costs that were not included in the analysis 
 Recommendations – Cost optimization suggestions 
 
Example 1: Analyze a serverless application 
Let’s create a cost analysis for a simple serverless application. Use the following prompt: 
Create a cost analysis for a serverless application using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. Assume 1 million API calls per month, average Lambda execution time of 200ms with 512MB memory, and 10GB of DynamoDB storage with 5 million read requests and 1 million write requests per month. Convert estimation to a PDF format. 
Upon entering your prompt, Amazon Q CLI will retrieve pricing data using the get_pricing_from_web or get_pricing_from_api tools, and will use generate_cost_report with awslabscost_analysis_mcp_server. 
 
You should receive an output giving a detailed cost breakdown based on the prompt along with optimization recommendations. 
 
 
The generated cost analysis shows the following information: 
 
 Amazon API Gateway costs for 1 million requests 
 AWS Lambda costs for compute time and requests 
 Amazon DynamoDB costs for storage, read, and write capacity 
 Total monthly cost estimate 
 Cost optimization recommendations 
 
Example 2: Analyze multi-tier architectures 
Multi-tier architectures separate applications into functional layers (presentation, application, and data) to improve scalability and security. This example analyzes costs for implementing such an architecture on AWS with components for each tier: 
Create a cost analysis for a three-tier web application with a presentation tier (ALB and CloudFront), application tier (ECS with Fargate), and data tier (Aurora PostgreSQL). Include costs for 2 Fargate tasks with 1 vCPU and 2GB memory each, an Aurora db.r5.large instance with 100GB storage, an Application Load Balancer with 10 
This time, we are formatting it into both PDF and DOCX. 
 
 
The cost analysis shows the following information: 
 
 Presentation tier costs (Application Load Balancer and AWS CloudFront) 
 Application tier costs (Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate) 
 Data tier costs (Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition) 
 Detailed breakdown of each component’s pricing 
 Total monthly cost estimate 
 Cost optimization recommendations for each tier 
 
Example 3: Compare deployment options 
When deploying containers on AWS, choosing between Amazon ECS with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or Fargate involves different cost structures and management overhead. This example compares these options to determine the most cost-effective solution for a specific workload: 
Compare the costs between running a containerized application on ECS with EC2 launch type versus Fargate launch type. Assume 4 containers each needing 1 vCPU and 2GB memory, running 24/7 for a month. For EC2, use t3.medium instances. Provide a recommendation on which option is more cost-effective for this workload. Convert estimation to a HTML webpage. 
This time, we are formatting it into a HTML webpage. 
 
 
The cost comparison includes the following information: 
 
 Amazon ECS with Amazon EC2 launch type costs 
 Amazon ECS with Fargate launch type costs 
 Detailed breakdown of each option’s pricing components 
 Side-by-side comparison of total costs 
 Recommendations for the most cost-effective option 
 Considerations for when each option might be preferred 
 
Real-world examples 
Let’s explore some real-world architecture patterns and how to analyze their costs using Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server. 
Ecommerce platform 
Ecommerce platforms require scalable, resilient architectures with careful cost management. These systems typically use microservices to handle various functions independently while maintaining high availability. This example analyzes costs for a complete ecommerce solution with multiple components serving moderate traffic levels: 
Create a cost analysis for an e-commerce platform with microservices architecture. Include components for product catalog, shopping cart, checkout, payment processing, order management, and user authentication. Assume moderate traffic of 500,000 monthly active users, 2 million page views per day, and 50,000 orders per month. Ensure the analysis follows AWS best practices for cost optimization. Convert estimation to a PDF format. 
 
The cost analysis includes the following key components: 
 
 Frontend delivery costs (Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and CloudFront) 
 API Gateway and Lambda costs for serverless components 
 Container costs for microservices (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and Amazon ECS) 
 Database costs (Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and DynamoDB) 
 Caching costs (Amazon ElastiCache) 
 Storage and data transfer costs 
 Monitoring and security costs 
 Total monthly cost estimate 
 Cost optimization recommendations for each component 
 Reserved instance and savings plan opportunities 
 
Data analytics platform 
Modern data analytics platforms need to efficiently ingest, store, process, and visualize large volumes of data while managing costs effectively. This example examines the AWS services and costs involved in building a complete analytics pipeline handling significant daily data volumes with multiple user access requirements: 
Create a cost analysis for a data analytics platform processing 500GB of new data daily. Include components for data ingestion (Kinesis), storage (S3), processing (EMR), and visualization (QuickSight). Assume 50 users accessing dashboards daily and data retention of 90 days. Ensure the analysis follows AWS best practices for cost optimization and includes recommendations for cost-effective scaling. Convert estimation to a HTML webpage. 
 
The cost analysis includes the following key components: 
 
 Data ingestion costs (Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and Amazon Data Firehose) 
 Storage costs (Amazon S3 with lifecycle policies) 
 Processing costs (Amazon EMR cluster) 
 Visualization costs (Amazon QuickSight) 
 Data transfer costs between services 
 Total monthly cost estimate 
 Cost optimization recommendations for each component 
 Scaling considerations and their cost implications 
 
Clean up 
If you no longer need to use the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server with Amazon Q CLI, you can remove it from your configuration: 
 
 Open your ~/.aws/amazonq/mcp.json file. 
 Remove or comment out the “awslabs.cost-analysis-mcp-server” entry. 
 Save the file. 
 
This will prevent the server from being loaded when you start Amazon Q CLI in the future. 
Conclusion 
In this post, we explored how to use Amazon Q CLI with the AWS Cost Analysis MCP server to create detailed cost analyses that use accurate AWS pricing data. This approach offers significant advantages over traditional cost estimation methods: 
 
 Time savings – Generate complex cost analyses in minutes instead of hours 
 Accuracy – Make sure estimates use the latest AWS pricing information 
 Comprehensive – Include relevant cost components and considerations 
 Actionable – Receive specific optimization recommendations 
 Iterative – Quickly compare different scenarios through simple prompts 
 Validation – Check estimates against official AWS pricing 
 
As you continue exploring AWS cost analysis, we encourage you to deepen your knowledge by learning more about the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to understand how it enhances the capabilities of Amazon Q. For hands-on cost estimation, the AWS Pricing Calculator offers an interactive experience to model and compare different deployment scenarios. To make sure your architectures follow financial best practices, the AWS Well-Architected Framework Cost Optimization Pillar provides comprehensive guidance on building cost-efficient systems. And to stay at the cutting edge of these tools, keep an eye on updates to the official AWS MCP servers—they’re constantly evolving with new features to make your cost analysis experience even more powerful and accurate.

• Tailor responsible AI with new safeguard tiers in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails
  Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards to help build trusted generative AI applications at scale. It provides organizations with integrated safety and privacy safeguards that work across multiple foundation models (FMs), including models available in Amazon Bedrock, as well as models hosted outside Amazon Bedrock from other model providers and cloud providers. With the standalone ApplyGuardrail API, Amazon Bedrock Guardrails offers a model-agnostic and scalable approach to implementing responsible AI policies for your generative AI applications. Guardrails currently offers six key safeguards: content filters, denied topics, word filters, sensitive information filters, contextual grounding checks, and Automated Reasoning checks (preview), to help prevent unwanted content and align AI interactions with your organization’s responsible AI policies. 
As organizations strive to implement responsible AI practices across diverse use cases, they face the challenge of balancing safety controls with varying performance and language requirements across different applications, making a one-size-fits-all approach ineffective. To address this, we’ve introduced safeguard tiers for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, so you can choose appropriate safeguards based on your specific needs. For instance, a financial services company can implement comprehensive, multi-language protection for customer-facing AI assistants while using more focused, lower-latency safeguards for internal analytics tools, making sure each application upholds responsible AI principles with the right level of protection without compromising performance or functionality. 
In this post, we introduce the new safeguard tiers available in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, explain their benefits and use cases, and provide guidance on how to implement and evaluate them in your AI applications. 
Solution overview 
Until now, when using Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, you were provided with a single set of the safeguards associated to specific AWS Regions and a limited set of languages supported. The introduction of safeguard tiers in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides three key advantages for implementing AI safety controls: 
 
 A tier-based approach that gives you control over which guardrail implementations you want to use for content filters and denied topics, so you can select the appropriate protection level for each use case. We provide more details about this in the following sections. 
 Cross-Region Inference Support (CRIS) for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, so you can use compute capacity across multiple Regions, achieving better scaling and availability for your guardrails. With this, your requests get automatically routed during guardrail policy evaluation to the optimal Region within your geography, maximizing available compute resources and model availability. This helps maintain guardrail performance and reliability when demand increases. There’s no additional cost for using CRIS with Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, and you can select from specific guardrail profiles for controlling model versioning and future upgrades. 
 Advanced capabilities as a configurable tier option for use cases where more robust protection or broader language support are critical priorities, and where you can accommodate a modest latency increase. 
 
Safeguard tiers are applied at the guardrail policy level, specifically for content filters and denied topics. You can tailor your protection strategy for different aspects of your AI application. Let’s explore the two available tiers: 
 
 Classic tier (default): 
   
   Maintains the existing behavior of Amazon Bedrock Guardrails 
   Limited language support: English, French, and Spanish 
   Does not require CRIS for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails 
   Optimized for lower-latency applications 
    
 Standard tier: 
   
   Provided as a new capability that you can enable for existing or new guardrails 
   Multilingual support for more than 60 languages 
   Enhanced robustness against prompt typos and manipulated inputs 
   Enhanced prompt attack protection covering modern jailbreak and prompt injection techniques, including token smuggling, AutoDAN, and many-shot, among others 
   Enhanced topic detection with improved understanding and handling of complex topics 
   Requires the use of CRIS for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and might have a modest increase in latency profile compared to the Classic tier option 
    
 
You can select each tier independently for content filters and denied topics policies, allowing for mixed configurations within the same guardrail, as illustrated in the following hierarchy. With this flexibility, companies can implement the right level of protection for each specific application. 
 
 Policy: Content filters 
   
   Tier: Classic or Standard 
    
 Policy: Denied topics 
   
   Tier: Classic or Standard 
    
 Other policies: Word filters, sensitive information filters, contextual grounding checks, and Automated Reasoning checks (preview) 
 
To illustrate how these tiers can be applied, consider a global financial services company deploying AI in both customer-facing and internal applications: 
 
 For their customer service AI assistant, they might choose the Standard tier for both content filters and denied topics, to provide comprehensive protection across many languages. 
 For internal analytics tools, they could use the Classic tier for content filters prioritizing low latency, while implementing the Standard tier for denied topics to provide robust protection against sensitive financial information disclosure. 
 
You can configure the safeguard tiers for content filters and denied topics in each guardrail through the AWS Management Console, or programmatically through the Amazon Bedrock SDK and APIs. You can use a new or existing guardrail. For information on how to create or modify a guardrail, see Create your guardrail. 
Your existing guardrails are automatically set to the Classic tier by default to make sure you have no impact on your guardrails’ behavior. 
Quality enhancements with the Standard tier 
According to our tests, the new Standard tier improves harmful content filtering recall by more than 15% with a more than 7% gain in balanced accuracy compared to the Classic tier. A key differentiating feature of the new Standard tier is its multilingual support, maintaining strong performance with over 78% recall and over 88% balanced accuracy for the most common 14 languages.The enhancements in protective capabilities extend across several other aspects. For example, content filters for prompt attacks in the Standard tier show a 30% improvement in recall and 16% gain in balanced accuracy compared to the Classic tier, while maintaining a lower false positive rate. For denied topic detection, the new Standard tier delivers a 32% increase in recall, resulting in an 18% improvement in balanced accuracy.These substantial evolutions in detection capabilities for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, combined with consistently low false positive rates and robust multilingual performance, also represent a significant advancement in content protection technology compared to other commonly available solutions. The multilingual improvements are particularly noteworthy, with the new Standard tier in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails showing consistent performance gains of 33–49% in recall across different language evaluations compared to other competitors’ options. 
Benefits of safeguard tiers 
Different AI applications have distinct safety requirements based on their audience, content domain, and geographic reach. For example: 
 
 Customer-facing applications often require stronger protection against potential misuse compared to internal applications 
 Applications serving global customers need guardrails that work effectively across many languages 
 Internal enterprise tools might prioritize controlling specific topics in just a few primary languages 
 
The combination of the safeguard tiers with CRIS for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails also addresses various operational needs with practical benefits that go beyond feature differences: 
 
 Independent policy evolution – Each policy (content filters or denied topics) can evolve at its own pace without disrupting the entire guardrail system. You can configure these with specific guardrail profiles in CRIS for controlling model versioning in the models powering your guardrail policies. 
 Controlled adoption – You decide when and how to adopt new capabilities, maintaining stability for production applications. You can continue to use Amazon Bedrock Guardrails with your previous configurations without changes and only move to the new tiers and CRIS configurations when you consider it appropriate. 
 Resource efficiency – You can implement enhanced protections only where needed, balancing security requirements with performance considerations. 
 Simplified migration path – When new capabilities become available, you can evaluate and integrate them gradually by policy area rather than facing all-or-nothing choices. This also simplifies testing and comparison mechanisms such as A/B testing or blue/green deployments for your guardrails. 
 
This approach helps organizations balance their specific protection requirements with operational considerations in a more nuanced way than a single-option system could provide. 
Configure safeguard tiers on the Amazon Bedrock console 
On the Amazon Bedrock console, you can configure the safeguard tiers for your guardrail in the Content filters tier or Denied topics tier sections by selecting your preferred tier. 
 
 
Use of the new Standard tier requires setting up cross-Region inference for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails, choosing the guardrail profile of your choice. 
 
Configure safeguard tiers using the AWS SDK 
You can also configure the guardrail’s tiers using the AWS SDK. The following is an example to get started with the Python SDK: 
 
 import boto3
import json

bedrock = boto3.client(
    "bedrock",
    region_name="us-east-1"
)

# Create a guardrail with Standard tier for both Content Filters and Denied Topics
response = bedrock.create_guardrail(
    name="enhanced-safety-guardrail",
    # cross-Region is required for STANDARD tier
    crossRegionConfig={
        'guardrailProfileIdentifier': 'us.guardrail.v1:0'
    },
    # Configure Denied Topics with Standard tier
    topicPolicyConfig={
        "topicsConfig": [
            {
                "name": "Financial Advice",
                "definition": "Providing specific investment advice or financial recommendations",
                "type": "DENY",
                "inputEnabled": True,
                "inputAction": "BLOCK",
                "outputEnabled": True,
                "outputAction": "BLOCK"
            }
        ],
        "tierConfig": {
            "tierName": "STANDARD"
        }
    },
    # Configure Content Filters with Standard tier
    contentPolicyConfig={
        "filtersConfig": [
            {
                "inputStrength": "HIGH",
                "outputStrength": "HIGH",
                "type": "SEXUAL"
            },
            {
                "inputStrength": "HIGH",
                "outputStrength": "HIGH",
                "type": "VIOLENCE"
            }
        ],
        "tierConfig": {
            "tierName": "STANDARD"
        }
    },
    blockedInputMessaging="I cannot respond to that request.",
    blockedOutputsMessaging="I cannot provide that information."
) 
 
Within a given guardrail, the content filter and denied topic policies can be configured with its own tier independently, giving you granular control over how guardrails behave. For example, you might choose the Standard tier for content filtering while keeping denied topics in the Classic tier, based on your specific requirements. 
For migrating existing guardrails’ configurations to use the Standard tier, add the sections highlighted in the preceding example for crossRegionConfig and tierConfig to your current guardrail definition. You can do this using the UpdateGuardrail API, or create a new guardrail with the CreateGuardrail API. 
Evaluating your guardrails 
To thoroughly evaluate your guardrails’ performance, consider creating a test dataset that includes the following: 
 
 Safe examples – Content that should pass through guardrails 
 Harmful examples – Content that should be blocked 
 Edge cases – Content that tests the boundaries of your policies 
 Examples in multiple languages – Especially important when using the Standard tier 
 
You can also rely on openly available datasets for this purpose. Ideally, your dataset should be labeled with the expected response for each case for assessing accuracy and recall of your guardrails. 
With your dataset ready, you can use the Amazon Bedrock ApplyGuardrail API as shown in the following example to efficiently test your guardrail’s behavior for user inputs without invoking FMs. This way, you can save the costs associated with the large language model (LLM) response generation. 
 
 import boto3
import json

bedrock_runtime = boto3.client(
    "bedrock-runtime",
    region_name="us-east-1"
)

# Test the guardrail with potentially problematic content
content = [
    {
        "text": {
            "text": "Your test prompt here"
        }
    }
]

response = bedrock_runtime.apply_guardrail(
    content=content,
    source="INPUT",
    guardrailIdentifier="your-guardrail-id",
    guardrailVersion="DRAFT"
)

print(json.dumps(response, indent=2, default=str)) 
 
Later, you can repeat the process for the outputs of the LLMs if needed. For this, you can use the ApplyGuardrail API if you want an independent evaluation for models in AWS or outside in another provider, or you can directly use the Converse API if you intend to use models in Amazon Bedrock. When using the Converse API, the inputs and outputs are evaluated with the same invocation request, optimizing latency and reducing coding overheads. 
Because your dataset is labeled, you can directly implement a mechanism for assessing the accuracy, recall, and potential false negatives or false positives through the use of libraries like SKLearn Metrics: 
 
 # scoring script
# labels and preds store list of ground truth label and guardrails predictions

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(labels, preds, labels=[0, 1]).ravel()

recall = tp / (tp + fn) if (tp + fn) != 0 else 0
fpr = fp / (fp + tn) if (fp + tn) != 0 else 0
balanced_accuracy = 0.5 * (recall + 1 - fpr) 
 
Alternatively, if you don’t have labeled data or your use cases have subjective responses, you can also rely on mechanisms such as LLM-as-a-judge, where you pass the inputs and guardrails’ evaluation outputs to an LLM for assessing a score based on your own predefined criteria. For more information, see Automate building guardrails for Amazon Bedrock using test-drive development. 
Best practices for implementing tiers 
We recommend considering the following aspects when configuring your tiers for Amazon Bedrock Guardrails: 
 
 Start with staged testing – Test both tiers with a representative sample of your expected inputs and responses before making broad deployment decisions. 
 Consider your language requirements – If your application serves users in multiple languages, the Standard tier’s expanded language support might be essential. 
 Balance safety and performance – Evaluate both the accuracy improvements and latency differences to make informed decisions. Consider if you can afford a few additional milliseconds of latency for improved robustness with the Standard tier or prefer a latency-optimized option for more straight forward evaluations with the Classic tier. 
 Use policy-level tier selection – Take advantage of the ability to select different tiers for different policies to optimize your guardrails. You can choose separate tiers for content filters and denied topics, while combining with the rest of the policies and features available in Amazon Bedrock Guardrails. 
 Remember cross-Region requirements – The Standard tier requires cross-Region inference, so make sure your architecture and compliance requirements can accommodate this. With CRIS, your request originates from the Region where your guardrail is deployed, but it might be served from a different Region from the ones included in the guardrail inference profile for optimizing latency and availability.

• Structured data response with Amazon Bedrock: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use
  Generative AI is revolutionizing industries by streamlining operations and enabling innovation. While textual chat interactions with GenAI remain popular, real-world applications often depend on structured data for APIs, databases, data-driven workloads, and rich user interfaces. Structured data can also enhance conversational AI, enabling more reliable and actionable outputs. A key challenge is that LLMs (Large Language Models) are inherently unpredictable, which makes it difficult for them to produce consistently structured outputs like JSON. This challenge arises because their training data mainly includes unstructured text, such as articles, books, and websites, with relatively few examples of structured formats. As a result, LLMs can struggle with precision when generating JSON outputs, which is crucial for seamless integration into existing APIs and databases. Models vary in their ability to support structured responses, including recognizing data types and managing complex hierarchies effectively. These capabilities can make a difference when choosing the right model. 
This blog demonstrates how Amazon Bedrock, a managed service for securely accessing top AI models, can help address these challenges by showcasing two alternative options: 
 
 Prompt Engineering:&nbsp;A straightforward approach to shaping structured outputs using well-crafted prompts. 
 Tool Use with the Bedrock Converse API:&nbsp;An advanced method that enables better control, consistency, and native JSON schema integration. 
 
We will use a customer review analysis example to demonstrate how Bedrock generates structured outputs, such as sentiment scores, with simplified Python code. 
Building a prompt engineering solution 
This section will demonstrate how to use prompt engineering effectively to generate structured outputs using Amazon Bedrock. Prompt engineering involves crafting precise input prompts to guide large language models (LLMs) in producing consistent and structured responses. It is a fundamental technique for developing Generative AI applications, particularly when structured outputs are required.Here are the five key steps we will follow: 
 
 Configure the Bedrock client and runtime parameters. 
 Create a JSON schema for structured outputs. 
 Craft a prompt and guide the model with clear instructions and examples. 
 Add a customer review as input data to analyse. 
 Invoke Bedrock, call the model, and process the response. 
 
While we demonstrate customer review analysis to generate a JSON output, these methods can also be used with other formats like XML or CSV. 
Step 1: Configure Bedrock 
To begin, we’ll set up some constants and initialize a Python Bedrock client connection object using the Python Boto3 SDK for Bedrock runtime, which facilitates interaction with Bedrock: 
 
The REGION specifies the AWS region for model execution, while the MODEL_ID identifies the specific Bedrock model. The TEMPERATURE constant controls the output randomness, where higher values increase creativity, and lower values maintain precision, such as when generating structured output. MAX_TOKENS determines the output length, balancing cost-efficiency and data completeness. 
Step 2: Define the Schema 
Defining a schema is essential for facilitating structured and predictable model outputs, maintaining data integrity, and enabling seamless API integration. Without a well-defined schema, models may generate inconsistent or incomplete responses, leading to errors in downstream applications. The JSON standard schema used in the code below serves as a blueprint for structured data generation, guiding the model on how to format its output with explicit instructions. 
Let’s create a JSON schema for customer reviews with three required fields:&nbsp;reviewId&nbsp;(string, max 50 chars),&nbsp;sentiment (number, -1 to 1), and&nbsp;summary&nbsp;(string, max 200 chars). 
 
Step 3: Craft the Prompt text 
To generate consistent, structured, and accurate responses, prompts must be clear and well-structured, as LLMs rely on precise input to produce reliable outputs. Poorly designed prompts can lead to ambiguity, errors, or formatting issues, disrupting structured workflows, so we follow these best practices: 
 
 Clearly outline the AI’s role and objectives to avoid ambiguity. 
 Divide tasks into smaller, manageable numbered steps for clarity. 
 Indicate that a JSON schema will be provided (see Step 5 below) to maintain a consistent and valid structure. 
 Use one-shot prompting with a sample output to guide the model; add more examples if needed for consistency, but avoid too many, as they may limit the model’s ability to handle new inputs. 
 Define how to handle missing or invalid data. 
 
 
Step 4: Integrate Input Data 
For demonstration purposes, we’ll include a review text in the prompt as a Python variable: 
 
Separating the input data with &lt;input&gt; tags improve readability and clarity, making it straightforward to identify and reference. This hardcoded input simulates real-world data integration. For production use, you might dynamically populate input data from APIs or user submissions. 
Step 5: Call Bedrock 
In this section, we construct a Bedrock request by defining a body object that includes the JSON schema, prompt, and input review data from previous steps. This structured request makes sure the model receives clear instructions, adheres to a predefined schema, and processes sample input data correctly. Once the request is prepared, we invoke Amazon Bedrock to generate a structured JSON response. 
 
We reuse the&nbsp;MAX_TOKENS,&nbsp;TEMPERATURE, and&nbsp;MODEL_ID constants defined in Step 1. The&nbsp;body&nbsp;object has essential inference configurations like&nbsp;anthropic_version&nbsp;for model compatibility and the&nbsp;messages&nbsp;array, which includes a single message to provide the model with task instructions, the schema, and the input data. The role defines the “speaker” in the interaction context, with user value representing the program sending the request. Alternatively, we could simplify the input by combining instructions, schema, and data into one text prompt, which is straightforward to manage but less modular. 
Finally, we use the&nbsp;client.invoke_model&nbsp;method to send the request. After invoking, the model processes the request, and the JSON data must be properly (not explained here) extracted from the Bedrock response. For example: 
 
Tool Use with the Amazon Bedrock Converse API 
In the previous chapter, we explored a solution using Bedrock Prompt Engineering. Now, let’s look at an alternative approach for generating structured responses with Bedrock. 
We will extend the previous solution by using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API, a consistent interface designed to facilitate multi-turn conversations with Generative AI models. The API abstracts model-specific configurations, including inference parameters, simplifying integration. 
A key feature of the Converse API is Tool Use (also known as Function Calling), which enables the model to execute external tools, such as calling an external API. This method supports standard JSON schema integration directly into tool definitions, facilitating output alignment with predefined formats. Not all Bedrock models support Tool Use, so make sure you check which models are compatible with these feature. 
Building on the previously defined data, the following code provides a straightforward example of Tool Use tailored to our curstomer review use case: 
 
In this code the&nbsp;tool_list&nbsp;defines a custom customer review analysis tool with its input schema and purpose, while the&nbsp;messages&nbsp;provide the earlier defined instructions and input data. Unlike in the previous prompt engineering example we used the earlier defined JSON schema in the definition of a tool. Finally, the&nbsp;client.converse&nbsp;call combines these components, specifying the tool to use and inference configurations, resulting in outputs tailored to the given schema and task. After exploring&nbsp;Prompt Engineering&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tool Use&nbsp;in Bedrock solutions for structured response generation, let’s now evaluate how different foundation models perform across these approaches. 
Test Results: Claude Models on Amazon Bedrock 
Understanding the capabilities of foundation models in structured response generation is essential for maintaining reliability, optimizing performance, and building scalable, future-proof Generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock. To evaluate how well models handle structured outputs, we conducted extensive testing of Anthropic’s Claude models, comparing&nbsp;prompt-based&nbsp;and&nbsp;tool-based&nbsp;approaches across 1,000 iterations per model. Each iteration processed 100 randomly generated items, providing broad test coverage across different input variations.The examples shown earlier in this blog are intentionally simplified for demonstration purposes, where Bedrock performed seamlessly with no issues. To better assess the models under real-world challenges, we used a more complex schema that featured nested structures, arrays, and diverse data types to identify edge cases and potential issues. The outputs were validated for adherence to the JSON format and schema, maintaining consistency and accuracy. The following diagram summarizes the results, showing the number of successful, valid JSON responses for each model across the two demonstrated approaches: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use. 
 
The results demonstrated that all models achieved over 93% success across both approaches, with Tool Use methods consistently outperforming prompt-based ones. While the evaluation was conducted using a highly complex JSON schema, simpler schemas result in significantly fewer issues, often nearly none. Future updates to the models are expected to further enhance performance. 
Final Thoughts 
In conclusion, we demonstrated two methods for generating structured responses with Amazon Bedrock: Prompt Engineering and Tool Use with the Converse API. Prompt Engineering is flexible, works with Bedrock models (including those without Tool Use support), and handles various schema types (e.g., Open API schemas), making it a great starting point. However, it can be fragile, requiring exact prompts and struggling with complex needs. On the other hand, Tool Use offers greater reliability, consistent results, seamless API integration, and runtime validation of JSON schema for enhanced control. 
For simplicity, we did not demonstrate a few areas in this blog. Other techniques for generating structured responses include using models with built-in support for configurable response formats, such as JSON, when invoking models, or leveraging constraint decoding techniques with third-party libraries like LMQL. Additionally, generating structured data with GenAI can be challenging due to issues like invalid JSON, missing fields, or formatting errors. To maintain data integrity and handle unexpected outputs or API failures, effective error handling, thorough testing, and validation are essential. 
To try the Bedrock techniques demonstrated in this blog, follow the steps to Run example Amazon Bedrock API requests through the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3). With pay-as-you-go pricing, you’re only charged for API calls, so little to no cleanup is required after testing. For more details on best practices, refer to the Bedrock prompt engineering guidelines and model-specific documentation, such as Anthropic’s best practices. 
Structured data is key to leveraging Generative AI in real-world scenarios like APIs, data-driven workloads, and rich user interfaces beyond text-based chat. Start using Amazon Bedrock today to unlock its potential for reliable structured responses.

• Using Amazon SageMaker AI Random Cut Forest for NASA’s Blue Origin spacecraft sensor data
  The successful deorbit, descent, and landing of spacecraft on the Moon requires precise control and monitoring of vehicle dynamics. Anomaly detection provides a unique utility for identifying important states that might represent vehicle behaviors of interest. By producing unique vehicle behavior points, critical spacecraft system states can be identified to be more appropriately addressed and potentially better understood. These identified states can be invaluable for efforts such as system failure mitigation, engineering design improvements, and mission planning. Today, space missions have become more frequent and complex, and the volume of telemetry data generated has grown exponentially. With this growth, methods of analyzing this data for anomalies need to effectively scale and without risking missing subtle, but important deviations in spacecraft behavior. Fortunately, AWS uses powerful AI/ML applications within Amazon SageMaker AI that can address these needs. 
In this post, we demonstrate how to use SageMaker AI to apply the Random Cut Forest (RCF) algorithm to detect anomalies in spacecraft position, velocity, and quaternion orientation data from NASA and Blue Origin’s demonstration of lunar Deorbit, Descent, and Landing Sensors (BODDL-TP). The presented analysis focuses on detecting anomalies in spacecraft dynamics data, including positions, velocities, and quaternion orientations. 
Solution overview 
This solution provides an effective approach to anomaly detection in spacecraft data. We begin with data preprocessing and cleaning to produce quality input for our analysis. Using SageMaker AI, we train an RCF model specifically for detecting anomalies in complex spacecraft dynamics data. To handle the substantial volume of telemetry data efficiently, we implement batch processing for anomaly detection across large datasets. 
After the model is trained and anomalies are detected, this solution produces robust visualization capabilities, presenting results with highlighted anomalies for clear interpretation of the findings. We use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for seamless data storage and retrieval, including both raw data and generated plots. Throughout the implementation, we maintain careful cost management of SageMaker AI instances by deleting resources after they’re used to achieve efficient utilization while maintaining performance. 
This combination of features creates a scalable, efficient pipeline for processing and analyzing spacecraft dynamics data, making it particularly suitable for space mission applications where reliability and precision are crucial. 
Key concepts 
In this section, we discuss some key concepts of spacecraft dynamics and machine learning (ML) in this solution. 
Position and velocity in spacecraft dynamics 
Position and velocity vectors in our NASA Blue Origin DDL data are represented in the Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system. This reference frame rotates with the Earth, making it ideal for tracking spacecraft relative to landing sites on the lunar surface. The position vector [x, y, z] in ECEF pinpoints the spacecraft’s location in three-dimensional space. Its origin is at Earth’s center, with the X-axis intersecting the prime meridian at the equator, the Y-axis 90 degrees east in the equatorial plane, and the Z-axis aligned with Earth’s rotational axis. Measured in meters, this position data can reveal crucial information about orbital descent trajectories, landing approach paths, terminal descent profiles, and final touchdown positioning. Complementing position data, the velocity vector [vx, vy, vz] represents the spacecraft’s rate of position change in each direction. Measured in meters per second, this velocity data is vital for monitoring descent rates, maintaining safe approach speeds, controlling deceleration profiles, and verifying landing constraints. Our RCF algorithm scrutinizes both position and velocity data for anomalies. In position data, it looks for anomalies that might be caused by unexpected trajectory deviations, unrealistic position jumps, sensor glitches, or data recording errors. For velocity, its detected anomalies might be due to sudden speed changes, unusual acceleration patterns, potential thruster misfires, or navigation system issues. The fusion of position and velocity data offers a comprehensive view of the spacecraft’s translational motion. When combined with quaternion data describing rotational state, we obtain a complete picture of the spacecraft’s dynamic state during critical mission phases. These metrics play essential roles in mission planning, real-time monitoring, post-flight analysis, safety verification, C2 (command and control), and overall system performance evaluation. By using these rich datasets and advanced anomaly detection techniques, we enhance our ability to achieve mission success and spacecraft safety throughout the dynamic phases of lunar deorbit, descent, and landing. 
Quaternions in spacecraft dynamics 
Quaternions play a crucial role in spacecraft attitude (orientation) representation. Although Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) are more intuitive, they can suffer from gimbal lock—a loss of one degree of freedom in certain orientations. Quaternions solve this problem by using a four-parameter representation that avoids such singularities. This representation consists of one scalar component (q0) and three vector components (q1, q2, q3), providing a robust mathematical framework for describing spacecraft orientation. In our NASA Blue Origin DDL data, quaternions serve a vital purpose: they represent the rotation from the spacecraft’s body-fixed coordinate system (CON) to the ECEF frame. This transformation is fundamental to several critical aspects of spacecraft operation, including maintaining precise attitude control during descent, preserving correct thrust vector orientation, facilitating accurate sensor measurements, and computing landing trajectories. For reliable anomaly detection, quaternion values must satisfy two essential mathematical properties. First, they must maintain unit magnitude, meaning the sum of their squared components (q0² + q1² + q2² + q3² = 1) equals one. Second, they must demonstrate continuity, avoiding sudden jumps that would indicate physically impossible rotations. These properties help confirm the validity of our orientation measurements and the effectiveness of our anomaly detection system. When our RCF algorithm identifies anomalies in quaternion data, these could signal various issues requiring attention. Such anomalies might indicate sensor malfunctions, attitude control system issues, data transmission errors, or actual problems with spacecraft orientation. By carefully monitoring these quaternion components alongside position and velocity data, we develop a comprehensive understanding of the spacecraft’s dynamic state during the critical phases of deorbit, descent, and landing. 
The Random Cut Forest algorithm 
Random Cut Forest is an unsupervised algorithm for detecting anomalies in high-dimensional data. The algorithm’s construction begins by creating multiple decision trees, each built through a process of repeatedly cutting the data space with random hyperplanes. This partitioning continues until each data point is isolated, creating a forest of trees that captures the underlying structure of the data. The novelty of RCF lies in the scoring mechanism. Points located in sparse regions of the data space that require fewer cuts to isolate score higher, while points in dense regions that need more cuts score lower. This fundamental principle allows the algorithm to assign anomaly scores inversely proportional to the number of cuts needed to isolate each point. Higher scores, therefore, indicate potential anomalies, making it straightforward to identify unusual patterns in the data. 
In our spacecraft dynamics context, we apply RCF to 10-dimensional vectors that combine position (three dimensions), velocity (three dimensions), and quaternion orientation (four dimensions). Each vector represents a specific moment in time during the spacecraft’s mission states. The flight patterns create dense regions in this high-dimensional space, while anomalies appear as isolated points in sparse regions. This data is high-dimensional, multivariate time series, and has no labels, which RCF handles fairly well while maintaining computational efficiency and handling sensor noise. For this use case, RCF is able to detect subtle deviations between data points of spacecraft dynamics while handling the complex relationships between position, velocity, and orientation parameters. These features of RCF make it an effective tool for spacecraft dynamics monitoring analysis and anomaly detection. 
Solution architecture 
The solution architecture implements anomaly detection for NASA-Blue Origin Lunar DDL data using the RCF algorithm, as illustrated in the following diagram. 
 
Our solution’s data flow begins with public DDL (Deorbit, Descent, and Landing) data securely stored in an S3 bucket. This data is then accessed through a SageMaker AI domain using JupyterLab, providing a powerful and flexible environment for data scientists and engineers. Within JupyterLab, we use a custom notebook to process the raw data and implement our anomaly detection algorithms. 
The core of our solution lies in the processing pipeline. It starts in the JupyterLab notebook, where we train an RCF model using SageMaker AI. After it’s trained, this model is deployed to a SageMaker AI endpoint, creating a scalable and responsive anomaly detection service. We then feed our spacecraft dynamics data through this model to identify potential anomalies. The pipeline concludes by generating detailed visualizations of these anomalies, providing clear and actionable insights. 
For output, our system saves both the detected anomaly data and the generated plots back to Amazon S3. This makes sure the results are securely stored and accessible for further analysis or reporting. Additionally, we preserve all training data and model outputs in Amazon S3, enabling reproducibility and facilitating iterative improvements to our anomaly detection process. Throughout these operations, we maintain robust security measures, using Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to enforce data privacy and integrity at every step of the process. 
Prerequisites 
Before standing up the project, you must set up the necessary tools and access rights: 
 
 The AWS environment should include an active AWS account with appropriate permissions for running ML workloads, along with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) for command line operations installed 
 Access to SageMaker AI is essential for the ML implementation 
 On the development side, Python 3.7 or later needs to be installed, along with several key Python packages: 
   
   Boto3 for AWS service integration 
   Pandas for data manipulation 
   Matplotlib for visualization 
   NumPy for numerical operations 
   The SageMaker AI Python SDK for interacting with the SageMaker services 
    
 
Set up the solution 
The setup process includes accessing the SageMaker AI environment, where all the data analysis and model training is executed. 
 
 On the SageMaker AI console, open the SageMaker domain details page. 
 Open JupyterLab, then create a new Python notebook instance for this project. 
 When the environment is ready, open a terminal in SageMaker AI JupyterLab to clone the project repository using the following commands: 
 
 
 git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/sample-SageMaker-ai-rcf-anomaly-detection-lunar-spacecraft.git
cd sample-SageMaker-ai-rcf-anomaly-detection-lunar-spacecraft 
 
 
 Install the required Python libraries: 
 
pip install -r requirements.txt 
This process will set up the necessary dependencies for running anomaly detection analysis on the spacecraft data. 
Execute anomaly detection 
Update the bucket_name and file_name variables in the script with your S3 bucket and data file names. 
Run the script in JupyterLab as a Jupyter notebook or run as a Python script: python Lunar_DDL_AD.py 
Upon execution, the notebook or script performs a series of automated tasks to analyze the spacecraft data. It begins by loading and preprocessing the raw data, making sure it’s in the correct format for analysis. Next, it trains and deploys an RCF model using SageMaker AI, establishing the foundation for our anomaly detection system. When the model is operational, it processes the spacecraft dynamics data to identify potential anomalies in position, velocity, and quaternion measurements. Finally, the script generates detailed visualizations of these findings and automatically uploads both the plots and analysis results to Amazon S3 for secure storage and straightforward access. 
Code structure 
The Python implementation centers around an anomaly detection pipeline, structured in the main script. At its core is the AnomalyDetector class, which orchestrates the entire workflow from data ingestion to visualization. This class contains several methods that together process spacecraft telemetry data and identify anomalies. 
The load_and_prepare_data method handles the initial data ingestion and preprocessing, making sure spacecraft measurements are properly formatted for analysis. After the data is prepared, train_and_deploy_model trains the RCF model and deploys it as a SageMaker endpoint. The predict_anomalies method then uses this trained model to identify unusual patterns in the spacecraft’s position, velocity, and quaternion data. 
For visualization and storage, the plot_results method creates detailed graphs highlighting detected anomalies, and upload_plot_to_s3 makes sure these visualizations are securely stored in Amazon S3 for future reference and centralized access. 
Together, these components create a comprehensive pipeline for processing spacecraft telemetry data and identifying potential anomalies that might warrant further investigation. 
Configuration 
Adjust the following parameters in the script as needed: 
 
 threshold_percentile for the threshold for anomaly classification 
 RCF hyperparameters in train_and_deploy_model: 
   
   feature_dim: Number of input features 
   num_samples_per_tree: Random data points per tree 
   num_trees: Number of trees in the algorithmic forest 
    
 batch_size in predict_anomalies for large datasets 
 
For RCF applications, the hyperparameters and threshold configuration significantly influence anomaly detections. We use the following configuration values for this example: 
 
 threshold_percentile=0.9 
 RCF hyperparameters in train_and_deploy_model(): 
   
   feature_dim=10 
   num_samples_per_tree=512 
   num_trees=100 
    
 batch_size=1000 in predict_anomalies() 
 
SageMaker AI instance type size for training and inference can affect anomaly results, processing time, and cost. In this example, we used an ml.m5.4xlarge instance for both training and inference. 
In addition, SageMaker AI can be integrated with various security features for protecting sensitive data and models. It’s possible to operate in no internet or VPC only modes so SageMaker AI instances remain isolated within your Amazon VPC. Secure data access can also be achieved through AWS PrivateLink, enabling private connections to Amazon S3 without internet exposure. Also, integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides fine-grained access control through custom user profiles, enforcing data privacy and adhering to the principle of least privilege, such as when using sensitive spacecraft telemetry data. These are some of the security enhancement services that can be applied according to your appropriate use case with SageMaker AI. 
Data 
The script uses public NASA-Blue Origin Demo of Lunar Deorbit, Descent, and Landing Sensors (BODDL-TP) data, which you can download. Make sure your data is in the correct format with columns for timestamps, positions, velocities, and quaternions. 
Results 
The script generates plots for positions, velocities, and quaternions. The respective data is plotted and the anomalies are plotted as an overlay in red. The plots are saved to the specified S3 bucket. Due to the small scale, the positions plot is difficult to observe anomalies. However, the SageMaker AI RCF algorithm can detect them and are highlighted in red. In the following plots, the sharp changes in velocities and quaternions correspond with the anomalies shown. 
 
Unlike the positions plot, the velocities plot shows discontinuities, which are detected as anomalies. This is likely due to rate changes for vehicle maneuvers during the deorbit, descent, and landing demonstration stages. 
 
Similarly to the velocities plot, the quaternions plot shows sharp changes, which are also detected as anomalies. This is likely due to rotational accelerations during vehicle maneuvers of the deorbit, descent, and landing demonstration stages. 
 
These anomalies most likely represent the lunar spacecraft vehicle dynamics at key maneuver stages of the deorbit, descent, and landing demonstration. Momentum wheels, thrusters, and various other C2 applications could be the cause of the observed abrupt positional, velocity, and quaternion changes being detected as anomalous. By having these results, data points of interest are indicated for more precise and potentially valuable analysis for improved vehicle health and status awareness. 
Clean up 
The provided script includes SageMaker AI endpoint deletion after training and inference to avoid any unnecessary charges. If you’re using JupyterLab and want to further avoid charges, stop the SageMaker AI instance running the RCF JupyterLab Python notebook. 
Conclusion 
In this post, we demonstrated how the SageMaker AI RCF algorithm can effectively detect anomalies in spacecraft dynamics data from NASA and Blue Origin’s lunar Deorbit, Descent, and Landing demonstration. By detecting anomalies for position, velocity, and quaternion orientation data, we’ve shown how ML can enhance space mission analysis, situational awareness, and autonomy. The built-in algorithm processes complex, multi-dimensional spacecraft telemetry data. Through efficient batch processing, we can analyze large-scale mission data effectively, and our visualization approach enables quick identification of potential issues in spacecraft dynamics. From there, the solution’s scalability shows the ability adapt to handle varying data volumes and mission durations, making it potentially suitable for a wide range of space applications. Although this solution applies to a lunar mission demonstration, the approach could have broad applications throughout the space industry. You can adapt the same architecture for various space operations, such as landing missions on other celestial bodies, orbital rendezvous, space station docking, and satellite constellations. This integration of AWS services with aerospace applications creates a robust, secure, and scalable platform for space mission analytics, which is becoming increasingly valuable as we continue to execute missions in the space environment. Looking forward, this solution opens many possibilities for enhancement and expansion. Real-time anomaly detection could be implemented for live mission data, providing immediate insights during critical operations. Also, the system could be enhanced by incorporating additional spacecraft parameters and sensor data, and automated alert services could be developed to provide immediate notification of detected anomalies. In addition, further developments might include extending the analysis to incorporate predictive ML models and creating custom metrics tailored to specific mission requirements. These potential advancements would continue to build upon the foundation we’ve established, creating even more powerful tools for spacecraft mission analysis. 
The code and implementation details are available in our GitHub repository, enabling you to adapt and enhance the solution for your specific needs. 
For space operations, the combination of cloud computing and ML have strong potential to play an increasingly crucial role in ensuring mission success. This solution demonstrates just one of many possible applications of AWS services for improving spacecraft mission compute and data analysis.

• Build an intelligent multi-agent business expert using Amazon Bedrock
  In this post, we demonstrate how to build a multi-agent system using multi-agent collaboration in Amazon Bedrock Agents to solve complex business questions in the biopharmaceutical industry. We show how specialized agents in research and development (R&amp;D), legal, and finance domains can work together to provide comprehensive business insights by analyzing data from multiple sources. 
Amazon Bedrock Agents and multi-agent collaboration 
Business intelligence and market research enable large and small businesses to capture the trends of the industry, competitive landscape through data, and influences key business strategies. For example, biopharmaceutical companies use data to understand drug market size, clinical trials, prevalence of side effects, and innovation and pitfalls through analyzing patent and legal briefs to form investment strategies. In doing so, organizations face the challenges of accessing and analyzing information scattered across multiple data sources. Consolidating and querying these disparate datasets can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring developers to navigate different data formats, query languages, and access mechanisms. Additionally, gaining a comprehensive understanding of an organization’s operations often requires combining data insights from various segments, such as legal, finance, and R&amp;D. 
Generative AI agentic systems have emerged as a promising solution, enabling organizations to use generative AI for autonomous reasoning and action-based tasks. However, many agentic systems to-date are built with a single-agent setup, which poses challenges in a complex business environment. Besides the challenge of managing multiple data sources, encoding information and guidance for multiple business domains might cause the prompt for an agent’s large language model (LLM) to grow to such an extent that is suffers from “forgetting the middle” of a long context. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the breadth vs. depth of knowledge for each domain that can be encoded in an agent effectively. Additionally, the use of a single LLM with an agent limits cost, latency, and accuracy optimizations for the selected model. 
Amazon Bedrock Agents and its multi-agent collaboration feature provides powerful, enterprise-ready solutions for addressing these challenges and building intelligent and automated agentic systems. As a managed service within the AWS ecosystem, Amazon Bedrock Agents offers seamless integration with AWS data sources, built-in security controls, and enterprise-grade scalability. It contains built-in support for additional Amazon Bedrock features such as Amazon Bedrock Guardrails and Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. The service significantly reduces deployment overhead, empowering developers to focus on agent logic through an API-driven, familiar AWS Cloud environment and console. The supervisor agent model with specialized sub-agents enables efficient distributed problem-solving, breaking down complex tasks with intelligent routing. 
In this post, we discuss how to build a multi-agent system using multi-agent collaboration to solve complex business questions faced in a fictional biopharmaceutical company that requires expertise and data from three specialized domains: R&amp;D, legal, and finance. We demonstrate how data in disparate sources can be combined intelligently to support complex reasoning, and how agent collaboration facilitates open-ended question answering, such as “What are the potential legal and financial risks associated with the side effects of therapeutic product X, and how might they affect the company’s long-term stock performance?” 
(Below image depicts the roles of supervisor agent and the 3 subagents being used in our pharmaceutical example along with the benefits of using Multi Agent Collaboration. ) 
 
Solution overview 
Our use case centers around PharmaCorp, a fictional pharmaceutical company, which faces the challenge of managing vast amounts of data across its Pharma R&amp;D, Legal, and Finance divisions. Each division works with structured data, such as stock prices, and unstructured data, such as clinical trial reports. The data for each division is located in different data stores, which makes it difficult for teams to access cross-functional insights and slows down decision-making processes. 
To address this, we build a multi-agent system with domain-specific sub-agents for each division using multi-agent collaboration within Amazon Bedrock Agents. These sub-agents efficiently handle data queries and information retrieval, and the main agent passes necessary context between sub-agents and synthesizes insights across divisions. The multi-agent setup empowers PharmaCorp to access expertise and information within minutes that would otherwise take hours of human effort to compile. This approach breaks down data silos and strengthens organizational collaboration. 
The following architecture diagram illustrates the solution setup. 
 
The main agent acts as an orchestrator, asking questions to multiple sub-agents and synthesizing retrieved data: 
 
 The R&amp;D sub-agent has access to clinical trial data through Amazon Athena and unstructured clinical trial reports 
 The legal sub-agent has access to unstructured patents and lawsuit legal briefs 
 The finance sub-agent has access to research budget data through Athena and historical stock price data stored in Amazon Redshift 
 
Each sub-agent has granular permissions to only access the data in its domain. Detailed information about the data and models used and main agent interactions are described in the following sections. 
Dataset 
We generated synthetic data using Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, comprised of three domains: Pharma R&amp;D, Legal, and Finance. The domains contain structured data stored in SQL tables and unstructured data that is used in domain knowledge bases. The data can be accessed through the following files: R&amp;D, Legal, Finance. 
Efforts have been made to align synthetic data within and across domains. For example, clinical trial reports map to each trial and side effects in related tables. Rises and dips in stock prices tend to correlate with patents and lawsuits. However, there might still be minor inconsistencies between data. 
Pharma R&amp;D domain 
The Pharma R&amp;D domain has three tables: Drugs, Drug Trials, and Side Effects. Each table is queried from Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) through Athena. The Drugs table contains information on the company’s available products, therapeutic areas, target conditions, mechanisms of action, development phase, discovery year, and lead scientist. The Drug Trials table contains information on specific trials for each drug such as phase, dates, number of participations, and outcomes. The Side Effects table contains side effects, frequency, and severity reported from each trial. 
The unstructured data for the Pharma R&amp;D domain consists of synthetic clinical trial reports for each trial, which contain more detailed information about the trial design, outcomes, and recommendations. 
Legal domain 
The Legal domain has unstructured data consisting of patents and lawsuit legal briefs. The patents contain information about invention background, description, and experimental results. The legal briefs contain information about lawsuit court proceedings, outcomes, and analysis. 
Finance domain 
The Finance domain has two tables: Stock Price and Research Budgets. The Stock Price table is stored in Amazon Redshift and contains PharmaCorp’s historical monthly stock prices and volume. Amazon Redshift is a database optimized for online analytical processing (OLAP), which generally entails analyzing large amounts of data and performing complex analysis, as might be done by analysts looking at historical stock prices. The Research Budgets table is accessed from Amazon S3 through Athena and contains annual budgets for each department. 
The data setup showcases how a multi-agent framework can synthesize data from multiple data sources and databases. In practice, data could also be stored in other databases such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). 
Models used 
Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet, which has a good balance of intelligence and speed, is used in this multi-agent demonstration. With the multi-agent setup, you can also employ a more intelligent or a smaller, faster model depending on the use case and requirements such as accuracy and latency. 
Prerequisites 
To deploy this solution, you need the following prerequisites: 
 
 An active AWS account. 
 Access to Amazon Titan Embeddings G1 – Text, Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet on Amazon Bedrock. For instructions, refer to Add or remove access to Amazon Bedrock foundation models. 
 
Deploy the solution 
To deploy the solution resources, we use AWS CloudFormation. The CloudFormation template creates two S3 buckets, two AWS Lambda functions, an Amazon Bedrock agent, an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base, and an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. 
Download the provided CloudFormation template, then complete the following steps to deploy the stack: 
 
 Open the AWS CloudFormation console (the preferred AWS Regions are us-west-2 or us-east-1 for the solution). 
 Choose Stacks in the navigation pane. 
 Choose Create stack and With new resources (standard). 
 Select Choose existing template and upload the provided CloudFormation template file. 
 Enter a stack name, then choose Next. 
 Leave the stack settings as default and choose Next. 
 Select the acknowledgement check box and create the stack. 
 
After the stack is complete, you can view the new supervisor agent on the Amazon Bedrock console. 
An example of agent collaboration 
After you deploy the solution, you can test the communication among agents that help answer complex questions across PharmaCorp’s three divisions. For example, we ask the main agent “How did the results of NeuroClear’s Phase 2 trials affect PharmaCorp’s stock price, patent filings, and potential legal risks?” 
This question requires a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between NeuroClear’s clinical trial results, financial impacts, and legal outcomes for PharmaCorp. Let’s see how the multi-agent system addresses this complex query. 
The main agent identifies that it needs input from three specialized sub-agents to fully assess how NeuroClear’s clinical trial results might impact PharmaCorp’s legal and financial performance. It breaks down the user’s question into key components and develops a plan to gather detailed insights from each expert. The following is its chain-of-thought reasoning, task breakdown, and sub-agent routing: 
 
 This is a complex question that requires information from all three divisions to 
provide a comprehensive answer. 
I need to:
Get information about NeuroClear's Phase 2 trial results from Pharmaceutical division
Check stock price movements around the trial period from Finance division
Look for any patent filings and legal implications from Legal division 
 
Then, the main agent asks a question to the R&amp;D sub-agent: 
 
 Please provide details about NeuroClear's Phase 2 clinical trials, including trial dates,
outcomes, success rates, and any significant findings or side effects. 
 
The R&amp;D sub-agent correctly plans and executes its own sequence of steps, which include performing queries and searching its own knowledge base. It responds with the following: 
 
 Based on the information from the knowledge base search and Athena database queries,
here are the key details about NeuroClear's Phase 2 clinical trials:

* There were two Phase 2 trials conducted for NeuroClear, a novel drug for treating 
Alzheimer's disease.
* The first trial ran from June 2019 to May 2020 with 250 participants. It showed a 
moderate success rate of 0.65 in slowing cognitive decline compared to placebo.
* The second trial ran from August 2021 to August 2022 with 400 participants. It had 
a slightly higher success rate of 0.68.
* Both trials were randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled. The dosages tested 
were 25mg, 50mg, and 75mg once daily.
* Primary endpoints were change in ADAS-Cog score and secondary endpoints included CDR-SB, 
hippocampal volume, and CSF biomarkers.
* Notable side effects observed included insomnia (frequency 0.14-0.15, severity 3), 
anxiety (frequency 0.12-0.13, severity 3), tremors (frequency 0.09-0.1, severity 2), 
and weight loss (frequency 0.08, severity 2).

The trials showed NeuroClear had moderate efficacy in slowing cognitive decline in 
Alzheimer's patients, with an acceptable safety profile. The results supported 
advancing NeuroClear to larger Phase 3 trials to further evaluate its potential 
as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease. 
 
The main agent takes this information and determines its next step: 
 
 Now that I have the trial dates and outcomes, I should check the stock price movements
during these periods and any patent/legal activities. 
 
It asks the finance sub-agent the following: 
 
  
  Please provide stock price analysis for two periods:

1. June 2019 - May 2020
2. August 2021 - August 2022

Specifically looking for significant price movements and trading volume changes around
the completion dates of these periods, which correspond to NeuroClear's Phase 2 trial
results. 
  
 The finance sub-agent plans and executes queries on its stock database and responds with the following: 
 
 
  
  Stock Price Analysis for NeuroClear's Phase 2 Trial Periods:

Period 1 (June 2019 - May 2020):
* Final closing price: $34.69
* Average price: $31.43
* Price range: $27.99 - $34.69
* Average daily volume: 630,874 shares
* The period ended with moderate trading volume (566,927 shares)

Period 2 (August 2021 - August 2022):
* Final closing price: $53.71
* Average price: $49.79
* Price range: $44.11 - $55.41
* Average daily volume: 640,098 shares
* The period ended with slightly lower volume (491,629 shares)

Key Observations:
* Significant price appreciation between periods, with Period 2 showing ~58% 
higher average prices
* Both periods showed similar trading volume patterns, with Period 2 showing 
slightly higher average volume
* The stock showed slight negative movement on both completion dates 
(-0.20% and -0.77% respectively) 
  
 The main agent then asks a question to the legal sub-agent: 
  
  Please provide information about:
1. Any patent filings related to NeuroClear, particularly during or after the 
Phase 2 trials (2019-2022)
2. Any legal risks or challenges identified related to NeuroClear's development 
or trial results during this period. 
  
 
 
 The legal sub-agent searches its knowledge base and responds with the following: 
  
  Based on the patent search results, two key patent filings related to NeuroClear 
during or after its Phase 2 trials from 2019-2022 were:

1. A blood-brain barrier penetration enhancer system using nanoparticles to improve 
delivery of neurological drugs like NeuroClear to the brain (Patent ID: PAT004, 
filed in 2022). This technology could have been developed to address challenges 
with getting NeuroClear across the blood-brain barrier during clinical trials.
2. A targeted neurological receptor blocker designed to selectively inhibit 
receptors implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (Patent ID: PAT003, filed in 2021). 
This suggests NeuroClear may work by blocking certain neural receptors involved in 
conditions like Alzheimer's disease.

The legal search results identified a few key legal risks and challenges related to 
NeuroClear's development and trial results from 2019-2022:

1. A product liability lawsuit alleging NeuroClear caused cognitive impairment in a 
patient, with evidence that PharmaCorp failed to properly warn about this risk despite 
internal knowledge of it (Case 2023-CV-006).
2. A class action lawsuit alleging failure to warn about the risk of seizures associated 
with NeuroClear use, based on medical records, expert testimony, and internal PharmaCorp 
documents showing awareness of this risk.
3. Another product liability case where PharmaCorp was found liable for failing to warn 
about risk of liver damage from a different product, suggesting potential issues with 
adequate risk disclosure for NeuroClear as well. 
  
 Finally, the main agent synthesizes the information it has received into a response to the user’s question: 
 
 
 NeuroClear's Phase 2 trials had mixed impacts across different aspects of 
PharmaCorp's operations:

Clinical Results:
- Two Phase 2 trials (2019-2020 and 2021-2022) showed moderate success in treating
 Alzheimer's disease
- Success rates of 0.65 and 0.68 respectively
- Notable side effects included insomnia, anxiety, tremors, and weight loss

Stock Performance:
- The stock showed resilience during both trial periods
- Average stock price increased significantly (58%) between the first and second trial periods
- Interestingly, both trial completion dates saw slight negative price movements (-0.20% and -0.77%)

Patents and Legal Implications:
- Two significant patents were filed:
* Blood-brain barrier penetration enhancer system (2022)
* Targeted neurological receptor blocker (2021)
- However, several legal risks emerged:
* Product liability lawsuit regarding cognitive impairment
* Class action lawsuit concerning seizure risks
* Potential issues with risk disclosure based on previous cases

These results suggest that while NeuroClear showed promising clinical potential 
and led to valuable intellectual property, it also exposed PharmaCorp to significant 
legal risks that could impact future development and commercialization. 
 
Through this example, we can see how multi-agent collaboration enables a comprehensive analysis of complex business questions by using specialized knowledge from different domains. The main agent effectively orchestrates the interaction between sub-agents, synthesizing their insights to provide a holistic answer that considers R&amp;D, financial, and legal aspects of the NeuroClear clinical trials and their potential impacts on PharmaCorp. 
Clean up 
When you’re done testing the agent, complete the following steps to clean up your AWS environment and avoid unnecessary charges: 
 
 Delete the S3 buckets: 
   
   On the Amazon S3 console, empty the buckets structured-data-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region} and unstructured-data-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}. Make sure that both of these buckets are empty by deleting the files. 
   Select each file, choose Delete, and confirm by entering the bucket name. 
    
 Delete the Lambda functions: 
   
   On the Lambda console, select the CopyDataLambda function. 
   Choose Delete and confirm the action. 
   Repeat these steps for the CopyUnstructuredDataLambda function. 
    
 Delete the Amazon Bedrock agent: 
   
   On the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Agents in the navigation pane. 
   Select the agent, then choose Delete. 
    
 Delete the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base in Bedrock: 
   
   On the Amazon Bedrock console, choose Knowledge bases under Builder tools in the navigation pane. 
   Select the knowledge base and choose Delete. 
    
 Delete the EC2 instance: 
   
   On the Amazon EC2 console, choose Instances in the navigation pane. 
   Select the EC2 instance you created, then choose Delete. 
    
 
Business impact 
Implementing this multi-agent system using Amazon Bedrock Agents can provide significant benefits for pharmaceutical companies. By automating data retrieval and analysis across domains, companies can reduce research time and enable faster, data-driven decision-making, especially when domain experts are distributed across different organizational units with limited direct interaction. The system’s ability to provide comprehensive, cross-functional insights in minutes can lead to improved risk mitigation, because potential legal and financial issues can be identified earlier by connecting disparate data points. This automation also allows for more effective allocation of human resources, freeing up experts to focus on high-value tasks rather than routine data analysis. 
Our example demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems in pharmaceutical research and development, but the applications of this technology extend far beyond a single use case. For example, biotech companies can accelerate the discovery of cancer biomarkers by having specialist agents extract genomic signals from Amazon Redshift, perform Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, and interpret CT scans in parallel. Large health systems could automatically aggregate patient records, lab results, and trial data to streamline care coordination and flag urgent cases. Travel agencies can orchestrate end‑to‑end itineraries, and firms can manage personalized client communications. For more information on potential applications, see the following posts:

 How agentic AI systems can solve the three most pressing problems in healthcare today 
 Unlocking complex problem-solving with multi-agent collaboration on Amazon Bedrock 
 Enabling complex generative AI applications with Amazon Bedrock Agents 
 
Although the potential of multi-agent systems is compelling across these diverse applications, it’s important to understand the practical considerations in implementing such systems. Complex orchestration workflows can drive up inference costs through multiple model calls, increase end‑to‑end latency, amplify testing and maintenance requirements, and introduce operational overhead around rate limits, retries, and inter‑agent or data connection protocols. However, the state of the art is rapidly advancing. New generations of faster, cheaper models can help keep per‑call expenses and latency low, and more powerful models can accomplish tasks in fewer turns. Observability tools offer end‑to‑end tracing and dashboarding for multi‑agent pipelines. Finally, protocols like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol are beginning to standardize the way agents access data, paving the way for robust multi‑agent ecosystems. 
Conclusion 
In this post, we explored how a multi-agent generative AI system, implemented with Amazon Bedrock Agents using multi-agent collaboration, addresses data access and analysis challenges across multiple business domains. Through a demo use case with a fictional pharmaceutical company managing data across its different divisions, we showcased how specialized sub-agents tailored to each domain streamline information retrieval and synthesis. Each sub-agent uses domain-optimized models and securely accesses relevant data sources, enabling the organization to generate cross-functional insights. 
With this multi-agent architecture, organizations can overcome data silos, enhance collaboration, and achieve efficient, data-driven decision-making while optimizing for cost, latency, and security. Amazon Bedrock Agents with multi-agent collaboration facilitates this setup by providing a secure, scalable framework that manages the collaboration, communication, and task delegation between agents.

• Driving cost-efficiency and speed in claims data processing with Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite
  Amazon operations span the globe, touching the lives of millions of customers, employees, and vendors every day. From the vast logistics network to the cutting-edge technology infrastructure, this scale is a testament to the company’s ability to innovate and serve its customers. With this scale comes a responsibility to manage risks and address claims—whether they involve worker’s compensation, transportation incidents, or other insurance-related matters. Risk managers oversee claims against Amazon throughout their lifecycle. Claim documents from various sources grow as the claims mature, with a single claim consisting of 75 documents on average. Risk managers are required to strictly follow the relevant standard operating procedure (SOP) and review the evolution of dozens of claim aspects to assess severity and to take proper actions, reviewing and addressing each claim fairly and efficiently. But as Amazon continues to grow, how are risk managers empowered to keep up with the growing number of claims? 
In December 2024, an internal technology team at Amazon built and implemented an AI-powered solution as applied to data related to claims against the company. This solution generates structured summaries of claims under 500 words across various categories, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy of the claims review process. However, the team faced challenges with high inference costs and processing times (3–5 minutes per claim), particularly as new documents are added. Because the team plans to expand this technology to other business lines, they explored Amazon Nova Foundation Models as potential alternatives to address cost and latency concerns. 
The following graphs show performance compared with latency and performance compared with cost for various foundation models on the claim dataset. 
 
The evaluation of the claims summarization use case proved that Amazon Nova foundation models (FMs) are a strong alternative to other frontier large language models (LLMs), achieving comparable performance with significantly lower cost and higher overall speed. The Amazon Nova Lite model demonstrates strong summarization capabilities in the context of long, diverse, and messy documents. 
Solution overview 
The summarization pipeline begins by processing raw claim data using AWS Glue jobs. It stores data into intermediate Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, and uses Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to manage summarization jobs. Claim summaries are generated by AWS Lambda using foundation models hosted in Amazon Bedrock. We first filter the irrelevant claim data using an LLM-based classification model based on Nova Lite and summarize only the relevant claim data to reduce the context window. Considering relevance and summarization requires different levels of intelligence, we select the appropriate models to optimize cost while maintaining performance. Because claims are summarized upon arrival of new information, we also cache the intermediate results and summaries using Amazon DynamoDB to reduce duplicate inference and reduce cost. The following image shows a high-level architecture of the claim summarization use case solution. 
 
Although the Amazon Nova team has published performance benchmarks across several different categories, claims summarization is a unique use case given its diversity of inputs and long context windows. This prompted the technology team owning the claims solution to investigate further with their own benchmarking study. To assess the performance, speed, and cost of Amazon Nova models for their specific use case, the team curated a benchmark dataset consisting of 95 pairs of claim documents and verified aspect summaries. Claim documents range from 1,000 to 60,000 words, with most being around 13,000 words (median 10,100). The verified summaries of these documents are usually brief, containing fewer than 100 words. Inputs to the models include diverse types of documents and summaries that cover a variety of aspects in production. 
According to benchmark tests, the team observed that Amazon Nova Lite is twice as fast and costs 98% less than their current model. Amazon Nova Micro is even more efficient, running four times faster and costing 99% less. The substantial cost-effectiveness and latency improvements offer more flexibility for designing a sophisticated model and scaling up test compute to improve summary quality. Moreover, the team also observed that the latency gap between Amazon Nova models and the next best model widened for long context windows and long output, making Amazon Nova a stronger alternative in the case of long documents while optimizing for latency. Additionally, the team performed this benchmarking study using the same prompt as the current in-production solution with seamless prompt portability. Despite this, Amazon Nova models successfully followed instructions and generated the desired format for post-processing. Based on the benchmarking and evaluation results, the team used Amazon Nova Lite for classification and summarization use cases. 
Conclusion 
In this post, we shared how an internal technology team at Amazon evaluated Amazon Nova models, resulting in notable improvements in inference speed and cost-efficiency. Looking back on the initiative, the team identified several critical factors that offer key advantages: 
 
 Access to a diverse model portfolio – The availability of a wide array of models, including compact yet powerful options such as Amazon Nova Micro and Amazon Nova Lite, enabled the team to quickly experiment with and integrate the most suitable models for their needs. 
 Scalability and flexibility – The cost and latency improvements of the Amazon Nova models allow for more flexibility in designing sophisticated models and scaling up test compute to improve summary quality. This scalability is particularly valuable for organizations handling large volumes of data or complex workflows. 
 Ease of integration and migration – The models’ ability to follow instructions and generate outputs in the desired format simplifies post-processing and integration into existing systems. 
 
If your organization has a similar use case of large document processing that is costly and time-consuming, the above evaluation exercise shows that Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Nova Micro can be game-changing. These models excel at handling large volumes of diverse documents and long context windows—perfect for complex data processing environments. What makes this particularly compelling is the models’ ability to maintain high performance while significantly reducing operational costs. It’s important to iterate over new models for all three pillars—quality, cost, and speed. Benchmark these models with your own use case and datasets.
