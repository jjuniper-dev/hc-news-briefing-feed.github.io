ü§ñ AI & Emerging Tech
‚Ä¢ Chinese universities want students to use more AI, not less
  Just two years ago, Lorraine He, now a 24-year-old law student,&nbsp; was told to avoid using AI for her assignments. At the time, to get around a national block on ChatGPT, students had to buy a mirror-site version from a secondhand marketplace. Its use was common, but it was at best tolerated and more often frowned upon. Now, her professors no longer warn students against using AI. Instead, they‚Äôre encouraged to use it‚Äîas long as they follow best practices.



She is far from alone. Just like those in the West, Chinese universities are going through a quiet revolution. According to a recent survey by the Mycos Institute, a Chinese higher-education research group, the use of generative AI on campus has become nearly universal. The same survey reports that just 1% of university faculty and students in China reported never using AI tools in their studies or work. Nearly 60% said they used them frequently‚Äîeither multiple times a day or several times a week.



However, there‚Äôs a crucial difference. While many educators in the West see AI as a threat they have to manage, more Chinese classrooms are treating it as a skill to be mastered. In fact, as the Chinese-developed model DeepSeek gains in popularity globally, people increasingly see it as a source of national pride. The conversation in Chinese universities has gradually shifted from worrying about the implications for academic integrity to encouraging literacy, productivity, and staying ahead.&nbsp;



The cultural divide is even more apparent in public sentiment. A report on global AI attitudes from Stanford University‚Äôs Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) found that China leads the world in enthusiasm. About 80% of Chinese respondents said they were ‚Äúexcited‚Äù about new AI services‚Äîcompared with just 35% in the US and 38% in the UK.



‚ÄúThis attitude isn‚Äôt surprising,‚Äù says Fang Kecheng, a professor in communications at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a long tradition in China of believing in technology as a driver of national progress, tracing back to the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping was already saying that science and technology are primary productive forces.‚Äù



From taboo to toolkit



Liu Bingyu, one of He‚Äôs professors at the China University of Political Science and Law, says AI can act as ‚Äúinstructor, brainstorm partner, secretary, and devil‚Äôs advocate.‚Äù She added a full session on AI guidelines to her lecture series this year, after the university encouraged ‚Äúresponsible and confident‚Äù use of AI.&nbsp;



Liu recommends that students use generative AI to write literature reviews, draft abstracts, generate charts, and organize thoughts. She‚Äôs created slides that lay out detailed examples of good and bad prompts, along with one core principle: AI can‚Äôt replace human judgment. ‚ÄúOnly high-quality input and smart prompting can lead to good results,‚Äù she says.





‚ÄúThe ability to interact with machines is one of the most important skills in today‚Äôs world,‚Äù Liu told her class. ‚ÄúAnd instead of having students do it privately, we should talk about it out in the open.‚Äù



This reflects a growing trend across the country. MIT Technology Review reviewed the AI strategies of 46 top Chinese universities and found that almost all of them have added interdisciplinary AI general‚Äëeducation classes, AI related degree programs and AI literacy modules in the past year. Tsinghua, for example, is establishing a new undergraduate general education college to train students in AI plus another traditional discipline, like biology, healthcare, science, or humanities.



Major institutions like Remin, Nanjing, and Fudan Universities have rolled out general-access AI courses and degree programs that are open to all students, not reserved for computer science majors like the traditional machine-learning classes. At Zhejiang University, an introductory AI class will become mandatory for undergraduates starting in 2024.&nbsp;



Lin Shangxin, principal of Renmin University of China recently told local media that AI was an ‚Äúunprecedented opportunity‚Äù for humanities and social sciences. ‚ÄúIntead of a challenge, I believe AI would empower humanities studies,‚Äù Lin said told The Paper.



The collective action echoes a central government push. In April 2025, the Ministry of Education released new national guidelines calling for sweeping ‚ÄúAI+ education‚Äù reforms, aimed at cultivating critical thinking, digital fluency, and real‚Äêworld skills at all education levels. Earlier this year, the Beijing municipal government mandated AI education across all schools in the city‚Äîfrom universities to K‚Äì12.



Fang believes that more formal AI literacy education will help bridge an emerging divide between students. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big gap in digital literacy,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúSome students are fluent in AI tools. Others are lost.‚Äù



Building the AI university



In the absence of Western tools like ChatGPT and Claude, many Chinese universities have begun deploying local versions of DeepSeek on campus servers to support students. Many top universities have deployed their own locally hosted versions of Deepseek. These campus-specific AI systems‚Äìoften referred to as the ‚Äúfull-blood version‚Äù of Deepseek‚Äîoffer longer context windows, unlimited dialogue rounds and broader functionality than public-facing free versions.&nbsp;





This mirrors a broader trend in the West, where companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are rolling out campus-wide education tiers‚ÄîOpenAI recently offered free ChatGPT Plus to all U.S. and Canadian college students, while Anthropic launched Claude for Education with partners like Northeastern and LSE. But in China, the initiative is typically university-led rather than driven by the companies themselves.



The goal, according to Zhejiang University, is to offer students full access to AI tools so they can stay up to date with the fast-changing technology. Students can use their ID to access the models for free.&nbsp;



Yanyan Li and Meifang Zhuo, two researchers at Warwick University who have studied students‚Äô use of AI at universities in the UK, believe that AI literacy education has become crucial to students‚Äô success.&nbsp;



With their colleague Gunisha Aggarwal, they conducted focus groups including college students from different backgrounds and levels to find out how AI is used in academic studies. They found that students‚Äô knowledge of how to use AI comes mainly from personal exploration. ‚ÄúWhile most students understand that AI output is not always trustworthy, we observed a lot of anxiety on how to use it right,‚Äù says Li.



‚ÄúThe goal shouldn‚Äôt be preventing students from using AI but guiding them to harness it for effective learning and higher-order thinking,‚Äù says Zhuo.&nbsp;



That lesson has come slowly. A student at Central China Normal University in Wuhan told MIT Technology Review that just a year ago, most of his classmates paid for mirror websites of ChatGPT, using VPNs or semi-legal online marketplaces to access Western models. ‚ÄúNow, everyone just uses DeepSeek and Doubao,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheaper, it works in Chinese, and no one‚Äôs worried about getting flagged anymore.‚Äù



Still, even with increased institutional support, many students feel anxious about whether they‚Äôre using AI correctly‚Äîor ethically. The use of AI detection tools has created an informal gray economy, where students pay hundreds of yuan to freelancers promising to ‚ÄúAI-detection-proof‚Äù their writing, according to a Rest of World report. Three students told MIT Technology Review that this environment has created confusion, stress, and increased anxiety. Across the board, they said they appreciate it when their professor offers clear policies and practical advice, not just warnings.



He, the law student in Beijing, recently joined a career development group to learn more AI skills to prepare for the job market. To many like her, understanding how to use AI better is not just a studying hack but a necessary skill in China‚Äôs fragile job market. Eighty percent of job openings available to fresh graduates listed AI-related skills as a plus in 2025, according to a report by the Chinese media outlet YiCai. In a slowed-down economy and a competitive job market, many students see AI as a lifeline.&nbsp;



¬†‚ÄúWe need to rethink what is considered ‚Äòoriginal work‚Äô in the age of AI‚Äù says Zhuo, ‚Äúand universities are a crucial site of that conversation‚Äù.
‚Ä¢ The Download: saving the US climate programs, and America‚Äôs AI protections are under threat
  This is today&#8217;s edition of¬†The Download,¬†our weekday newsletter that provides a daily dose of what&#8217;s going on in the world of technology.



How nonprofits and academia are stepping up to salvage US climate programs



Nonprofits are trying to preserve a US effort to modernize greenhouse-gas measurements, amid growing fears that the Trump administration‚Äôs dismantling of federal programs will obscure the nation‚Äôs contributions to climate change.



The Data Foundation, a Washington, DC, nonprofit, is fundraising for an initiative that will coordinate efforts among nonprofits, technical experts, and companies to improve the accuracy and accessibility of climate emissions information. It will build on an effort to improve the collection of emissions data that former president Joe Biden launched in 2023‚Äîand which President Trump nullified on his first day in office.&nbsp;



The new greenhouse-gas coalition is one of a growing number of nonprofit and academic groups that have spun up or shifted focus to keep essential climate monitoring and research efforts going amid the Trump administration‚Äôs assault on environmental funding, staffing, and regulations. Read the full story.

America‚Äôs AI watchdog is losing its bite



Most Americans encounter the Federal Trade Commission only if they‚Äôve been scammed: It handles identity theft, fraud, and stolen data. During the Biden administration, the agency went after AI companies for scamming customers with deceptive advertising or harming people by selling irresponsible technologies.&nbsp;



With the announcement of President Trump‚Äôs AI Action Plan, that era may now be over.The new plan suggests that the Trump administration believes the agency‚Äôs previous actions went too far, and that it would be reviewing all FTC actions taken under the Biden administration.The move is the latest in its evolving attack on the agency, which provides a significant route of redress for people harmed by AI in the US. It‚Äôs likely to result in faster deployment of AI with fewer checks on accuracy, fairness, or consumer harm. Read the full story.



‚ÄîJames O‚ÄôDonnell







Trump‚Äôs AI Action Plan is a distraction



‚ÄîAsad Ramzanali is the director of artificial intelligence and technology policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.



On Wednesday, President Trump issued three executive orders, delivered a speech, and released an action plan, all on the topic of continuing American leadership in AI.



This flurry of actions made for glitzy press moments, including an hour-long speech from the president and onstage signings. But while the tech industry cheered these announcements (which will swell their coffers), they obscured the fact that the administration is currently decimating the very policies that enabled America to become the world leader in AI in the first place.

The deadly saga of the controversial gene therapy Elevidys



It has been a grim few months for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) community. There had been some excitement when, a couple of years ago, a gene therapy for the disorder was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first time. That drug, Elevidys, has now been implicated in the deaths of two teenage boys.



The drug‚Äôs approval was always controversial‚Äîthere was a lack of evidence that it actually worked, for starters. But the agency that once rubber-stamped the drug has now turned on its manufacturer, Sarepta Therapeutics. In a remarkable chain of events, the FDA asked the company to stop shipping the drug on July 18. Sarepta refused to comply.In the days since, the company has acquiesced. But its reputation has already been hit. And the events have dealt a devastating blow to people desperate for treatments that might help them, their children, or other family members with DMD.

‚Ä¢ The deadly saga of the controversial gene therapy Elevidys
  It has been a grim few months for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) community. There had been some excitement when, a couple of years ago, a gene therapy for the disorder was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the first time. That drug, Elevidys, has now been implicated in the deaths of two teenage boys.



The drug‚Äôs approval was always controversial‚Äîthere was a lack of evidence that it actually worked, for starters. But the agency that once rubber-stamped the drug has now turned on its manufacturer, Sarepta Therapeutics. In a remarkable chain of events, the FDA asked the company to stop shipping the drug on July 18. Sarepta refused to comply.





In the days since, the company has acquiesced. But its reputation has already been hit. And the events have dealt a devastating blow to people desperate for treatments that might help them, their children, or other family members with DMD.



DMD is a rare genetic disorder that causes muscles to degenerate over time. It‚Äôs caused by a mutation in a gene that codes for a protein called dystrophin. That protein is essential for muscles‚Äîwithout it, muscles weaken and waste away. The disease mostly affects boys, and symptoms usually start in early childhood.



At first, affected children usually start to find it hard to jump or climb stairs. But as the disease progresses, other movements become difficult too. Eventually, the condition might affect the heart and lungs. The life expectancy of a person with DMD has recently improved, but it is still only around 30 or 40 years. There is no cure. It‚Äôs a devastating diagnosis.



Elevidys was designed to replace missing dystrophin with a shortened, engineered version of the protein. In June 2023,¬†the FDA approved the therapy for eligible four- and five-year-olds. It came with a $3.2 million price tag.



The approval was celebrated by people affected by DMD, says Debra Miller, founder of CureDuchenne, an organization that funds research into the condition and offers support to those affected by it. &#8220;We&#8217;ve not had much in the way of meaningful therapies,&#8221; she says. &#8220;The excitement was great.&#8221;



But the approval was controversial. It came under an ‚Äúaccelerated approval‚Äù program that essentially lowers the bar of evidence for drugs designed to treat ‚Äúserious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need.‚Äù



Elevidys was approved because it appeared to increase levels of the engineered protein in patients‚Äô muscles. But it had not been shown to improve patient outcomes: It had failed a randomized clinical trial.



The FDA approval was granted on the condition that Sarepta complete another clinical trial. The¬†topline results of that trial were described in October 2023 and¬†were published in detail a year later. Again, the drug failed to meet its ‚Äúprimary endpoint‚Äù‚Äîin other words, it didn‚Äôt work as well as hoped.



In June 2024, the FDA expanded the approval of Elevidys. It granted traditional approval for the drug to treat people with DMD who are over the age of four and can walk independently, and another accelerated approval for those who can‚Äôt.





Some experts were appalled at the FDA‚Äôs decision‚Äîeven some within the FDA disagreed with it. But things weren‚Äôt so simple for people living with DMD. I spoke to some parents of such children¬†a couple of years ago. They pointed out that drug approvals can help bring interest and investment to DMD research. And, above all, they were desperate for any drug that might help their children. They were desperate for hope.



Unfortunately, the treatment does not appear to be delivering on that hope. There have always been questions over whether it works. But now there are serious questions over how safe it is.¬†



In March 2025, a 16-year-old boy died after being treated with Elevidys. He had developed acute liver failure (ALF) after having the treatment, Sarepta¬†said in a statement. On June 15, the company¬†announced a second death‚Äîa 15-year-old who also developed ALF following Elevidys treatment. The company said it would pause shipments of the drug,¬†but only for patients who are not able to walk.



The following day, Sarepta held¬†an online presentation in which CEO Doug Ingram said that the company was exploring ways to make the treatment safer, perhaps by treating recipients with another drug that dampens their immune systems. But that same day, the company announced that¬†it was laying off 500 employees‚Äî36% of its workforce. Sarepta did not respond to a request for comment.



On June 24, the FDA¬†announced that it was investigating the risks of serious outcomes ‚Äúincluding hospitalization and death‚Äù associated with Elevidys, and ‚Äúevaluating the need for further regulatory action.‚Äù



There was more tragic news on July 18, when there were¬†reports that a third patient had died following a Sarepta treatment. This patient, a 51-year-old, hadn‚Äôt been taking Elevidys but was enrolled in a clinical trial for a different Sarepta gene therapy designed to treat limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The same day,¬†the FDA asked Sarepta to voluntarily pause all shipments of Elevidys. Sarepta¬†refused to do so.



The refusal was surprising, says Michael Kelly, chief scientific officer at CureDuchenne: ‚ÄúIt was an unusual step to take.‚Äù



After¬†significant¬†media¬†coverage, including reporting that¬†the FDA was ‚Äúdeeply troubled‚Äù by the decision and would use its ‚Äúfull regulatory authority,‚Äù Sarepta backed down a few days later. On July 21, the company announced its decision to¬†‚Äúvoluntarily and temporarily‚Äù pause all shipments of Elevidys in the US.



Sarepta says it will now work with the FDA to address safety and labeling concerns. But in the meantime, the saga has left the DMD community grappling with ‚Äúa mix of disappointment and concern,‚Äù says Kelly. Many are worried about the risks of taking the treatment. Others are devastated that they are no longer able to access it.



Miller says she knows of families who have been working with their insurance providers to get authorization for the drug. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the rug has been pulled out from under them,&#8221; she says. Many families have no other treatment options. &#8220;And we know what happens when you do nothing with Duchenne,&#8221; she says. Others, particularly those with teenage children with DMD, are deciding against trying the drug, she adds. 



The decision over whether to take Elevidys was already a personal one based on several factors, he says. People with DMD and their families deserve clear and transparent information about the treatment in order to make that decision.



The FDA&#8217;s decision to approve Elevidys was made on limited data, says Kelly. But as things stand today, over 900 people have been treated with Elevidys. &#8220;That gives the FDA&#8230; an opportunity to look at real data and make informed decisions,&#8221; he says. 



‚ÄúFamilies facing Duchenne do not have time to waste,‚Äù Kelly says. ‚ÄúThey must navigate a landscape where hope is tempered by the realities of medical complexity.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ How nonprofits and academia are stepping up to salvage US climate programs
  Nonprofits are striving to preserve a US effort to modernize greenhouse-gas measurements, amid growing fears that the Trump administration‚Äôs dismantling of federal programs will obscure the nation‚Äôs contributions to climate change.



The Data Foundation, a Washington, DC, nonprofit that advocates for open data, is fundraising for an initiative that will coordinate efforts among nonprofits, technical experts, and companies to improve the accuracy and accessibility of climate emissions information. It will build on an effort to improve the collection of emissions data that former president Joe Biden launched in 2023‚Äîand which President Trump nullified on his first day in office.&nbsp;



The initiative will help prioritize responses to changes in federal greenhouse-gas monitoring and measurement programs, but the Data Foundation stresses that it will primarily serve a ‚Äúlong-standing need for coordination‚Äù of such efforts outside of government agencies.



The new greenhouse-gas coalition is one of a growing number of nonprofit and academic groups that have spun up or shifted focus to keep essential climate monitoring and research efforts going amid the Trump administration‚Äôs assault on environmental funding, staffing, and regulations. Those include efforts to ensure that US scientists can continue to contribute to the UN‚Äôs major climate report and publish assessments of the rising domestic risks of climate change. Otherwise, the loss of these programs will make it increasingly difficult for communities to understand how more frequent or severe wildfires, droughts, heat waves, and floods will harm them‚Äîand how dire the dangers could become.&nbsp;



Few believe that nonprofits or private industry can come close to filling the funding holes that the Trump administration is digging. But observers say it‚Äôs essential to try to sustain efforts to understand the risks of climate change that the federal government has historically overseen, even if the attempts are merely stopgap measures.&nbsp;



If we give up these sources of emissions data, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre flying blind,‚Äù says Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deliberating taking away the very information that would help us understand the problem and how to address it best.‚Äù



Improving emissions estimates



The Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Forest Service, and other agencies have long collected information about greenhouse gases in a variety of ways. These include self-reporting by industry; shipboard, balloon, and aircraft readings of gas concentrations in the atmosphere; satellite measurements of the carbon dioxide and methane released by wildfires; and on-the-ground measurements of trees. The EPA, in turn, collects and publishes the data from these disparate sources as the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.





But that report comes out on a two-year lag, and studies show that some of the estimates it relies on could be way off‚Äîparticularly the self-reported ones.



A recent analysis using satellites to measure methane pollution from four large landfills found they produce, on average, six times more emissions than the facilities had reported to the EPA. Likewise, a 2018 study in Science found that the actual methane leaks from oil and gas infrastructure were about 60% higher than the self-reported estimates in the agency‚Äôs inventory.



The Biden administration‚Äôs initiative‚Äîthe National Strategy to Advance an Integrated US Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Monitoring, and Information System‚Äîaimed to adopt state-of-the-art tools and methods to improve the accuracy of these estimates, including satellites and other monitoring technologies that can replace or check self-reported information.



The administration specifically sought to achieve these improvements through partnerships between government, industry, and nonprofits. The initiative called for the data collected across groups to be published to an online portal in formats that would be accessible to policymakers and the public.



Moving toward a system that produces more current and reliable data is essential for understanding the rising risks of climate change and tracking whether industries are abiding by government regulations and voluntary climate commitments, says Ben Poulter, a former NASA scientist who coordinated the Biden administration effort as a deputy director in the Office of Science and Technology Policy.



‚ÄúOnce you have this operational system, you can provide near-real-time information that can help drive climate action,‚Äù Poulter says. He is now a senior scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit focused on accelerating emerging methods of combating climate change, and he is advising the Data Foundation‚Äôs Climate Data Collaborative, which is overseeing the new greenhouse-gas initiative.&nbsp;



Slashed staffing and funding&nbsp;&nbsp;



But the momentum behind the federal strategy deflated when Trump returned to office. On his first day, he signed an executive order that effectively halted it. The White House has since slashed staffing across the agencies at the heart of the effort, sought to shut down specific programs that generate emissions data, and raised uncertainties about the fate of numerous other program components.&nbsp;



In April, the administration missed a deadline to share the updated greenhouse-gas inventory with the United Nations, for the first time in three decades, as E&amp;E News reported. It eventually did release the report in May, but only after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a Freedom of Information Act request.



There are also indications that the collection of emissions data might be in jeopardy. In March, the EPA said it would ‚Äúreconsider‚Äù the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which requires thousands of power plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities to report emissions each year.



In addition, the tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law earlier this month rescinds provisions in Biden‚Äôs Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives or funding for corporate greenhouse-gas reporting and methane monitoring.&nbsp;



Meanwhile, the White House has also proposed slashing funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and shuttering a number of its labs. Those include the facility that supports the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, the world‚Äôs longest-running carbon dioxide measuring program, as well as the Global Monitoring Laboratory, which operates a global network of collection flasks that capture air samples used to measure concentrations of nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other greenhouse gases.



Under the latest appropriations negotiations, Congress seems set to spare NOAA and other agencies the full cuts pushed by the Trump administration, but that may or may not protect various climate programs within them. As observers have noted, the loss of experts throughout the federal government, coupled with the priorities set by Trump-appointed leaders of those agencies, could still prevent crucial emissions data from being collected, analyzed, and published.



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a huge concern,‚Äù says David Hayes, a professor at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, who previously worked on the effort to upgrade the nation‚Äôs emissions measurement and monitoring as special assistant to President Biden for climate policy. It‚Äôs not clear ‚Äúwhether they‚Äôre going to continue and whether the data availability will drop off.‚Äù



‚ÄòA natural disaster‚Äô



Amid all these cutbacks and uncertainties, those still hoping to make progress toward an improved system for measuring greenhouse gases have had to adjust their expectations: It‚Äôs now at least as important to simply preserve or replace existing federal programs as it is to move toward more modern tools and methods.



But Ryan Alexander, executive director of the Data Foundation‚Äôs Climate Data Collaborative, is optimistic that there will be opportunities to do both.&nbsp;



She says the new greenhouse-gas coalition will strive to identify the highest-priority needs and help other nonprofits or companies accelerate the development of new tools or methods. It will also aim to ensure that these organizations avoid replicating one another‚Äôs efforts and deliver data with high scientific standards, in open and interoperable formats.&nbsp;



The Data Foundation declines to say what other nonprofits will be members of the coalition or how much money it hopes to raise, but it plans to make a formal announcement in the coming weeks.&nbsp;



Nonprofits and companies are already playing a larger role in monitoring emissions, including organizations like Carbon Mapper, which operates satellites and aircraft that detect and measure methane emissions from particular facilities. The EDF also launched a satellite last year, known as MethaneSAT, that could spot large and small sources of emissions‚Äîthough it lost power earlier this month and probably cannot be recovered.&nbsp;



Alexander notes that shifting from self-reported figures to observational technology like satellites could not just replace but perhaps also improve on the EPA reporting program that the Trump administration has moved to shut down.



Given the ‚Äúdramatic changes‚Äù brought about by this administration, ‚Äúthe future will not be the past,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThis is like a natural disaster. We can‚Äôt think about rebuilding in the way that things have been in the past. We have to look ahead and say, ‚ÄòWhat is needed? What can people afford?‚Äô‚Äù



Organizations can also use this moment to test and develop emerging technologies that could improve greenhouse-gas measurements, including novel sensors or artificial intelligence tools, Hayes says.&nbsp;



‚ÄúWe are at a time when we have these new tools, new technologies for measurement, measuring, and monitoring,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúTo some extent it‚Äôs a new era anyway, so it‚Äôs a great time to do some pilot testing here and to demonstrate how we can create new data sets in the climate area.‚Äù



Saving scientific contributions



It‚Äôs not just the collection of emissions data that nonprofits and academic groups are hoping to save. Notably, the American Geophysical Union and its partners have taken on two additional climate responsibilities that traditionally fell to the federal government.



The US State Department‚Äôs Office of Global Change historically coordinated the nation‚Äôs contributions to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change‚Äôs major reports on climate risks, soliciting and nominating US scientists to help write, oversee, or edit sections of the assessments. The US Global Change Research Program, an interagency group that ran much of the process, also covered the cost of trips to a series of in-person meetings with international collaborators.&nbsp;



But the US government seems to have relinquished any involvement as the IPCC kicks off the process for the Seventh Assessment Report. In late February, the administration blocked federal scientists including NASA‚Äôs Katherine Calvin, who was previously selected as a cochair for one of the working groups, from attending an early planning meeting in China. (Calvin was the agency‚Äôs chief scientist at the time but was no longer serving in that role as of April, according to NASA‚Äôs website.)



The agency didn‚Äôt respond to inquiries from interested scientists after the UN panel issued a call for nominations in March, and it failed to present a list of nominations by the deadline in April, scientists involved in the process say. The Trump administration also canceled funding for the Global Change Research Program and, earlier this month, fired the last remaining staffers working at the Office of Global Change.



In response, 10 universities came together in March to form the US Academic Alliance for the IPCC, in partnership with the AGU, to request and evalute applications from US researchers. The universities‚Äîwhich include Yale, Princeton, and the University of California, San Diego‚Äîtogether nominated nearly 300 scientists, some of whom the IPCC has since officially selected. The AGU is now conducting a fundraising campaign to help pay for travel expenses.&nbsp;





Pamela McElwee, a professor at Rutgers who helped establish the academic coalition, says it‚Äôs crucial for US scientists to continue participating in the IPCC process.



‚ÄúIt is our flagship global assessment report on the state of climate, and it plays a really important role in influencing country policies,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTo not be part of it makes it much more difficult for US scientists to be at the cutting edge and advance the things we need to do.‚Äù&nbsp;



The AGU also stepped in two months later, after the White House dismissed hundreds of researchers working on the National Climate Assessment, an annual report analyzing the rising dangers of climate change across the country. The AGU and American Meteorological Society together announced plans to publish a ‚Äúspecial collection‚Äù to sustain the momentum of that effort.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,‚Äù said Brandon Jones, president of the AGU, in an earlier statement.



The AGU declined to discuss the status of the project.



Stopgap solution



The sheer number of programs the White House is going after will require organizations to make hard choices about what they attempt to save and how they go about it. Moreover, relying entirely on nonprofits and companies to take over these federal tasks is not viable over the long term.&nbsp;



Given the costs of these federal programs, it could prove prohibitive to even keep a minimum viable version of some essential monitoring systems and research programs up and running. Dispersing across various organizations the responsibility of calculating the nation‚Äôs emissions sources and sinks also creates concerns about the scientific standards applied and the accessibility of that data, Cleetus says. Plus, moving away from the records that NOAA, NASA, and other agencies have collected for decades would break the continuity of that data, undermining the ability to detect or project trends.



More basically, publishing national emissions data should be a federal responsibility, particularly for the government of the world‚Äôs second-largest climate polluter, Cleetus adds. Failing to calculate and share its contributions to climate change sidesteps the nation‚Äôs global responsibilities and sends a terrible signal to other countries.&nbsp;



Poulter stresses that nonprofits and the private sector can do only so much, for so long, to keep these systems up and running.



‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to give the impression that this greenhouse-gas coalition, if it gets off the ground, is a long-term solution,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt afford to have gaps in these data sets, so somebody needs to step in and help sustain those measurements.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Trump‚Äôs AI Action Plan is a distraction
  On Wednesday, President Trump issued three executive orders, delivered a speech, and released an action plan, all on the topic of continuing American leadership in AI.¬†



The plan contains dozens of proposed actions, grouped into three ‚Äúpillars‚Äù: accelerating innovation, building infrastructure, and leading international diplomacy and security. Some of its recommendations are thoughtful even if incremental, some clearly serve ideological ends, and many enrich big tech companies, but the plan is just a set of recommended actions.&nbsp;



The three executive orders, on the other hand, actually operationalize one subset of actions from each pillar:&nbsp;




One aims to prevent ‚Äúwoke AI‚Äù by mandating that the federal government procure only large language models deemed ‚Äútruth-seeking‚Äù and ‚Äúideologically neutral‚Äù rather than ones allegedly favoring DEI. This action purportedly accelerates AI innovation.



A second aims to accelerate construction of AI data centers. A much more industry-friendly version of an order issued under President Biden, it makes available rather extreme policy levers, like effectively waiving a broad swath of environmental protections, providing government grants to the wealthiest companies in the world, and even offering federal land for private data centers.



A third promotes and finances the export of US AI technologies and infrastructure, aiming to secure American diplomatic leadership and reduce international dependence on AI systems from adversarial countries.




This flurry of actions made for glitzy press moments, including an hour-long speech from the president and onstage signings. But while the tech industry cheered these announcements (which will swell their coffers), they obscured the fact that the administration is currently decimating the very policies that enabled America to become the world leader in AI in the first place.



To maintain America‚Äôs leadership in AI, you have to understand what produced it. Here are four specific long-standing public policies that helped the US achieve this leadership‚Äîadvantages that the administration is undermining.&nbsp;



Investing federal funding in R&amp;D&nbsp;



Generative AI products released recently by American companies, like ChatGPT, were developed with industry-funded research and development. But the R&amp;D that enables today‚Äôs AI was actually funded in large part by federal government agencies‚Äîlike the Defense Department, the National Science Foundation, NASA, and the National Institutes of Health‚Äîstarting in the 1950s. This includes the first successful AI program in 1956, the first chatbot in 1961, and the first expert systems for doctors in the 1970s, along with breakthroughs in machine learning, neural networks, backpropagation, computer vision, and natural-language processing.





American tax dollars also funded advances in hardware, communications networks, and other technologies underlying AI systems. Public research funding undergirded the development of lithium-ion batteries, micro hard drives, LCD screens, GPS, radio-frequency signal compression, and more in today‚Äôs smartphones, along with the chips used in AI data centers, and even the internet itself.



Instead of building on this world-class research history, the Trump administration is slashing R&amp;D funding, firing federal scientists, and squeezing leading research universities. This week‚Äôs action plan recommends investing in R&amp;D, but the administration‚Äôs actual budget proposes cutting nondefense R&amp;D by 36%. It also proposed actions to better coordinate and guide federal R&amp;D, but coordination won‚Äôt yield more funding.



Some say that companies‚Äô R&amp;D investments will make up the difference. However, companies conduct research that benefits their bottom line, not necessarily the national interest. Public investment allows broad scientific inquiry, including basic research that lacks immediate commercial applications but sometimes ends up opening massive markets years or decades later. That‚Äôs what happened with today‚Äôs AI industry.



Supporting immigration and immigrants



Beyond public R&amp;D investment, America has long attracted the world‚Äôs best researchers and innovators.



Today‚Äôs generative AI is based on the transformer model (the T in ChatGPT), first described by a team at Google in 2017. Six of the eight researchers on that team were born outside the US, and the other two are children of immigrants.&nbsp;



This isn‚Äôt an exception. Immigrants have been central to American leadership in AI. Of the 42 American companies included in the 2025 Forbes ranking of the 50 top AI startups, 60% have at least one immigrant cofounder, according to an analysis by the Institute for Progress. Immigrants also cofounded or head the companies at the center of the AI ecosystem: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, and AMD.



‚ÄúBrain drain‚Äù is a term that was first coined to describe scientists‚Äô leaving other countries for the US after World War II‚Äîto the Americans‚Äô benefit. Sadly, the trend has begun reversing this year. Recent studies suggest that the US is already losing its AI talent edge through the administration‚Äôs anti-immigration actions (including actions taken against AI researchers) and cuts to R&amp;D funding.



Banning noncompetes



Attracting talented minds is only half the equation; giving them freedom to innovate is just as crucial.



Silicon Valley got its name because of mid-20th&#8211;century companies that made semiconductors from silicon, starting with the founding of Shockley Semiconductor in 1955. Two years later, a group of employees, the ‚ÄúTraitorous Eight,‚Äù quit to launch a competitor, Fairchild Semiconductor. By the end of the 1960s, successive groups of former Fairchild employees had left to start Intel, AMD, and others collectively dubbed the ‚ÄúFairchildren.‚Äù&nbsp;



Software and internet companies eventually followed, again founded by people who had worked for their predecessors. In the 1990s, former Yahoo employees founded WhatsApp, Slack, and Cloudera; the ‚ÄúPayPal Mafia‚Äù created LinkedIn, YouTube, and fintech firms like Affirm. Former Google employees have launched more than 1,200 companies, including Instagram and Foursquare.





AI is no different. OpenAI has founders that worked at other tech companies and alumni who have gone on to launch over a dozen AI startups, including notable ones like Anthropic and Perplexity.



This labor fluidity and the innovation it has created were possible in large part, according to many historians, because California‚Äôs 1872 constitution has been interpreted to prohibit noncompete agreements in employment contracts‚Äîa statewide protection the state originally shared only with North Dakota and Oklahoma. These agreements bind one in five American workers.



Last year, the Federal Trade Commission under President Biden moved to ban noncompetes nationwide, but a Trump-appointed federal judge has halted the action. The current FTC has signaled limited support for the ban and may be comfortable dropping it. If noncompetes persist, American AI innovation, especially outside California, will be limited.



Pursuing antitrust actions



One of this week‚Äôs announcements requires the review of FTC investigations and settlements that ‚Äúburden AI innovation.‚Äù During the last administration the agency was reportedly investigating Microsoft‚Äôs AI actions, and several big tech companies have settlements that their lawyers surely see as burdensome, meaning this one action could thwart recent progress in antitrust policy. That‚Äôs an issue because, in addition to the labor fluidity achieved by banning noncompetes, antitrust policy has also acted as a key lubricant to the gears of Silicon Valley innovation.&nbsp;





Major antitrust cases in the second half of the 1900s, against AT&amp;T, IBM, and Microsoft, allowed innovation and a flourishing market for semiconductors, software, and internet companies, as the antitrust scholar Giovanna Massarotto has described.



William Shockley was able to start the first semiconductor company in Silicon Valley only because AT&amp;T had been forced to license its patent on the transistor as part of a consent decree resolving a DOJ antitrust lawsuit against the company in the 1950s.&nbsp;



The early software market then took off because in the late 1960s, IBM unbundled its software and hardware offerings as a response to antitrust pressure from the federal government. As Massarotto explains, the 1950s AT&amp;T consent decree also aided the flourishing of open-source software, which plays a major role in today‚Äôs technology ecosystem, including the operating systems for mobile phones and cloud computing servers.



Meanwhile, many attribute the success of early 2000s internet companies like Google to the competitive breathing room created by the federal government‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft in the 1990s.&nbsp;



Over and over, antitrust actions targeting the dominant actors of one era enabled the formation of the next. And today, big tech is stifling the AI market. While antitrust advocates were rightly optimistic about this administration‚Äôs posture given key appointments early on, this week‚Äôs announcements should dampen that excitement.&nbsp;



I don‚Äôt want to lose focus on where things are: We should want a future in which lives are improved by the positive uses of AI.&nbsp;



But if America wants to continue leading the world in this technology, we must invest in what made us leaders in the first place: bold public research, open doors for global talent, and fair competition.&nbsp;



Prioritizing short-term industry profits over these bedrock principles won‚Äôt just put our technological future at risk‚Äîit will jeopardize America‚Äôs role as the world‚Äôs innovation superpower.&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Phishers Target Aviation Execs to Scam Customers
  KrebsOnSecurity recently heard from a reader whose boss&#8217;s email account got phished and was used to trick one of the company&#8217;s customers into sending a large payment to scammers. An investigation into the attacker&#8217;s infrastructure points to a long-running Nigerian cybercrime ring that is actively targeting established companies in the transportation and aviation industries.
Image: Shutterstock, Mr. Teerapon Tiuekhom.
A reader who works in the transportation industry sent a tip about a recent successful phishing campaign that tricked an executive at the company into entering their credentials at a fake Microsoft 365 login page. From there, the attackers quickly mined the executive&#8217;s inbox for past communications about invoices, copying and modifying some of those messages with new invoice demands that were sent to some of the company&#8217;s customers and partners.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the reader said the resulting phishing emails to customers came from a newly registered domain name that was remarkably similar to their employer&#8217;s domain, and that at least one of their customers fell for the ruse and paid a phony invoice. They said the attackers had spun up a look-alike domain just a few hours after the executive&#8217;s inbox credentials were phished, and that the scam resulted in a customer suffering a six-figure financial loss.
The reader also shared that the email addresses in the registration records for the imposter domain &#8212; roomservice801@gmail.com &#8212; is tied to many such phishing domains. Indeed, a search on this email address at DomainTools.com finds it is associated with at least 240 domains registered in 2024 or 2025. Virtually all of them mimic legitimate domains for companies in the aerospace and transportation industries worldwide.
An Internet search for this email address reveals a humorous blog post from 2020 on the Russian forum hackware[.]ru, which found roomservice801@gmail.com was tied to a phishing attack that used the lure of phony invoices to trick the recipient into logging in at a fake Microsoft login page. We&#8217;ll come back to this research in a moment.
JUSTY JOHN
DomainTools shows that some of the early domains registered to roomservice801@gmail.com in 2016 include other useful information. For example, the WHOIS records for alhhomaidhicentre[.]biz reference the technical contact of &#8220;Justy John&#8221; and the email address justyjohn50@yahoo.com.
A search at DomainTools found justyjohn50@yahoo.com has been registering one-off phishing domains since at least 2012. At this point, I was convinced that some security company surely had already published an analysis of this particular threat group, but I didn&#8217;t yet have enough information to draw any solid conclusions.
DomainTools says the Justy John email address is tied to more than two dozen domains registered since 2012, but we can find hundreds more phishing domains and related email addresses simply by pivoting on details in the registration records for these Justy John domains. For example, the street address used by the Justy John domain axisupdate[.]net &#8212; 7902 Pelleaux Road in Knoxville, TN &#8212; also appears in the registration records for accountauthenticate[.]com, acctlogin[.]biz, and loginaccount[.]biz, all of which at one point included the email address rsmith60646@gmail.com.
That Rsmith Gmail address is connected to the 2012 phishing domain alibala[.]biz (one character off of the Chinese e-commerce giant alibaba.com, with a different top-level domain of .biz). A search in DomainTools on the phone number in those domain records &#8212; 1.7736491613 &#8212; reveals even more phishing domains as well as the Nigerian phone number &#8220;2348062918302&#8221; and the email address michsmith59@gmail.com.
DomainTools shows michsmith59@gmail.com appears in the registration records for the domain seltrock[.]com, which was used in the phishing attack documented in the 2020 Russian blog post mentioned earlier. At this point, we are just two steps away from identifying the threat actor group.
The same Nigerian phone number shows up in dozens of domain registrations that reference the email address sebastinekelly69@gmail.com, including 26i3[.]net, costamere[.]com, danagruop[.]us, and dividrilling[.]com. A Web search on any of those domains finds they were indexed in an &#8220;indicator of compromise&#8221; list on GitHub maintained by Palo Alto Networks&#8216; Unit 42 research team.
SILVERTERRIER
According to Unit 42, the domains are the handiwork of a vast cybercrime group based in Nigeria that it dubbed &#8220;SilverTerrier&#8221; back in 2014. In an October 2021 report, Palo Alto said SilverTerrier excels at so-called &#8220;business e-mail compromise&#8221; or BEC scams, which target legitimate business email accounts through social engineering or computer intrusion activities. BEC criminals use that access to initiate or redirect the transfer of business funds for personal gain.
Palo Alto says SilverTerrier encompasses hundreds of BEC fraudsters, some of whom have been arrested in various international law enforcement operations by Interpol. In 2022, Interpol and the Nigeria Police Force arrested 11 alleged SilverTerrier members, including a prominent SilverTerrier leader who&#8217;d been flaunting his wealth on social media for years. Unfortunately, the lure of easy money, endemic poverty and corruption, and low barriers to entry for cybercrime in Nigeria conspire to provide a constant stream of new recruits.
BEC scams were the 7th most reported crime tracked by the FBI&#8217;s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) in 2024, generating more than 21,000 complaints. However, BEC scams were the second most costly form of cybercrime reported to the feds last year, with nearly $2.8 billion in claimed losses.¬†In its 2025 Fraud and Control Survey Report, the Association for Financial Professionals found 63 percent of organizations experienced a BEC last year.
Poking at some of the email addresses that spool out from this research reveals a number of Facebook accounts for people residing in Nigeria or in the United Arab Emirates, many of whom do not appear to have tried to mask their real-life identities. Palo Alto&#8217;s Unit 42 researchers reached a similar conclusion, noting that although a small subset of these crooks went to great lengths to conceal their identities, it was usually simple to learn their identities on social media accounts and the major messaging services.
Palo Alto said BEC actors have become far more organized over time, and that while it remains easy to find actors working as a group, the practice of using one phone number, email address or alias to register malicious infrastructure in support of multiple actors has made it far more time consuming (but not impossible) for cybersecurity and law enforcement organizations to sort out which actors committed specific crimes.
&#8220;We continue to find that SilverTerrier actors, regardless of geographical location, are often connected through only a few degrees of separation on social media platforms,&#8221; the researchers wrote.
FINANCIAL FRAUD KILL CHAIN
Palo Alto has published a useful list of recommendations that organizations can adopt to minimize the incidence and impact of BEC attacks. Many of those tips are prophylactic, such as conducting regular employee security training and reviewing network security policies.
But one recommendation &#8212; getting familiar with a process known as the &#8220;financial fraud kill chain&#8221; or FFKC &#8212; bears specific mention because it offers the single best hope for BEC victims who are seeking to claw back payments made to fraudsters, and yet far too many victims don&#8217;t know it exists until it is too late.
Image: ic3.gov.
As explained in this FBI primer, the International Financial Fraud Kill Chain is a partnership between federal law enforcement and financial entities whose purpose is to freeze fraudulent funds wired by victims. According to the FBI, viable victim complaints filed with ic3.gov promptly after a fraudulent transfer (generally less than 72 hours) will be automatically triaged by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
The FBI noted in its IC3 annual report (PDF) that the FFKC had a 66 percent success rate in 2024. Viable ic3.gov complaints involve losses of at least $50,000, and include all records from the victim or victim bank, as well as a completed FFKC form (provided by FinCEN) containing victim information, recipient information, bank names, account numbers, location, SWIFT, and any additional information.

‚Ä¢ Navigating medical education in the era of generative AI
  In November 2022, OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT kick-started a new era in AI. This was followed less than a half year later by the release of GPT-4. In the months leading up to GPT-4‚Äôs public release, Peter Lee, president of Microsoft Research, cowrote a book full of optimism for the potential of advanced AI models to transform the world of healthcare. What has happened since? In this special podcast series, The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited, Lee revisits the book, exploring how patients, providers, and other medical professionals are experiencing and using generative AI today while examining what he and his coauthors got right‚Äîand what they didn‚Äôt foresee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



In this episode, Dr. Morgan Cheatham (opens in new tab) and Daniel Chen (opens in new tab), two rising physicians and experts in both medicine and technology, join Lee to explore how generative AI is reshaping medical education. Cheatham, a partner and head of healthcare and life sciences at Breyer Capital and a resident physician at Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, discusses how AI is changing how clinicians acquire and apply medical knowledge at the point of care, emphasizing the need for training and curriculum changes to help ensure AI is used responsibly and that clinicians are equipped to maximize its potential. Chen, a medical student at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, shares how he and his peers use AI tools as study aids, clinical tutors, and second opinions and reflects on the risks of overreliance and the importance of preserving critical thinking.

[BOOK PASSAGE]&nbsp;



PETER LEE: ‚ÄúMedicine often uses the training approach when trying to assess multipurpose talent. To ensure students can safely and effectively take care of patients, we have them jump through quite a few hoops, &#8230; [and] they need good evaluations once they reach the clinic, passing grades on more exams like the USMLE [United States Medical Licensing Examination]. &#8230; [But] GPT-4 gets more than 90 percent of questions on licensing exams correct. &#8230; Does that provide any level of comfort in using GPT-4 in medicine?‚Äù&nbsp;

[THEME MUSIC]‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ&nbsp;



This is The AI Revolution in Medicine, Revisited. I‚Äôm your host, Peter Lee.‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ&nbsp;



Shortly after OpenAI&#8217;s GPT-4 was publicly released, Carey Goldberg, Dr. Zak Kohane, and I published The AI Revolution in Medicine to help educate the world of healthcare and medical research about the transformative impact this new generative AI technology could have. But because we wrote the book when GPT-4 was still a secret, we had to speculate. Now, two years later, what did we get right, and what did we get wrong?‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ‚ÄØ&nbsp;



In this series, we‚Äôll talk to clinicians, patients, hospital administrators, and others to understand the reality of AI in the field and where we go from here.



				
				
					



[THEME MUSIC FADES]‚ÄØ&nbsp;



The book passage I read at the top is from Chapter 4, ‚ÄúTrust but Verify.‚Äù In it, we explore how AI systems like GPT-4 should be evaluated for performance, safety, and reliability and compare this to how humans are both trained and assessed for readiness to deliver healthcare.&nbsp;



In previous conversations with guests, we‚Äôve spoken a lot about AI in the clinic as well as in labs and companies developing AI-driven tools. We‚Äôve also talked about AI in the hands of patients and consumers. But there has been some discussion also about AI‚Äôs role in medical training. And, as a founding board member of a new medical school at Kaiser Permanente, I definitely have my own thoughts about this. But today, I‚Äôm excited to welcome two guests who represent the next generation of medical professionals for their insights, Morgan Cheatham and Daniel Chen.&nbsp;



Morgan Cheatham is a graduate of Brown University&#8217;s Warren Alpert Medical School with clinical training in genetics at Harvard and is a clinical fellow at Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital. While Morgan is a bona fide doctor in training, he‚Äôs also amazingly an influential health technology strategist. He was recently named partner and head of healthcare and life sciences at Breyer Capital and has led investments in several healthcare AI companies that have eclipsed multibillion-dollar valuations.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Daniel Chen is finishing his second year as a medical student at the Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine. He holds a neuroscience degree from the University of Washington and was a research assistant in the Raskind Lab at the UW School of Medicine, working with imaging and genetic data analyses for biomedical research. Prior to med school, Daniel pursued experiences that cultivated his interest in the application of AI in medical practice and education.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Daniel and Morgan exemplify the real-world future of healthcare, a student entering his third year of medical school and a fresh medical-school graduate who is starting a residency while at the same time continuing his work on investing in healthcare startups.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]‚ÄØ



Here is my interview with Morgan Cheatham:&nbsp;



LEE: Morgan, thanks for joining. Really, really looking forward to this chat.&nbsp;



MORGAN CHEATHAM: Peter, it&#8217;s a privilege to be here with you. Thank you.&nbsp;



LEE: So are there any other human beings who are partners at big-league venture firms, residents at, you know, a Harvard-affiliated medical center, author, editor for a leading medical journal? I mean, who are your ‚Ä¶ who&#8217;s your cohort? Who are your peers?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I love this question. There are so many people who I consider peers that I look up to who have paved this path. And I think what is distinct about each of them is they have this physician-plus orientation. They are multilingual in terms of knowing the language of medicine but having learned other disciplines. And we share a common friend, Dr. Zak Kohane, who was among the first to really show how you can meld two worlds as a physician and make significant contributions to the intersections thereof.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I also deeply, in the world of business, respect physicians like Dr. Krishna Yeshwant at Google Ventures, who simultaneously pursued residency training and built what is now, you know, a large and enduring venture firm.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So there are plenty of people out there who&#8217;ve carved their own path and become these multilingual beings, and I aspire to be one.&nbsp;



LEE: So, you know, one thing I&#8217;ve been trying to explore with people are their origins with respect to the technology of AI. And there&#8217;s two eras for that. There&#8217;s AI before ChatGPT and before, you know, generative AI really became a big thing, and then afterwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So let&#8217;s start first before ChatGPT. You know, what was your contact? What was, you know, your knowledge of AI and machine learning?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Sure, so my experiences in computer science date back to high school. I went to Thomas Jefferson, which is a high school in Alexandria, Virginia, that prides itself on requiring students to take computer science in their first year of high school as kind of a required torturous experience. [LAUGHTER] And I remember that fondly. Our final project was Brick Breaker. It was actually, I joke, all hard coded. So there was nothing intelligent about the Brick Breaker that we built. But that was my first exposure.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I was a classics nerd, and I was really interested in biology and chemistry as a pre-medical student. So I really wouldn&#8217;t intersect with this field again until I was shadowing at Inova Hospital, which was a local hospital near me. And it was interesting because, at the time‚ÄîI was shadowing in the anesthesia department‚Äîthey were actually implementing their first instance of Epic.&nbsp;



LEE: Mmm. Wow.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: And I remember that experience fondly because the entire hospital was going from analog‚Äîthey were going from paper-based charts‚Äîto this new digital system. And I didn&#8217;t quite know in that moment what it would mean for the field or for my career, but I knew it was a big deal because a lot of people had a lot of emotion around what was going on, and it was in that experience that I kind of decided to attach myself to the intersection of computation and medicine. So when I got to undergrad, I was a pre-medical student. I was very passionate about studying the sacred physician-patient relationship and everything that had to go on in that exam room to provide excellent care.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But there were a few formative experiences: one, working at a physician-founded startup that was using at the time we called it big data, if you remember, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yup.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ to match the right patient to the right provider at the right time. And it was in that moment that I realized that as a physician, I could utilize technology to scale that sacred one-to-one patient-provider interaction in nonlinear ways. So that was, kind of, the first experience where I saw deployed systems that were using patient data and clinical information in an intelligent format.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. And so you&#8217;re a pre-medical student, but you have this computer science understanding. You have an intuition, I guess is the right way to say it, that the clinical data becoming digital is going to be important. So then what happens from there to your path to medical school?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Yeah, so I had a few formative research experiences in my undergraduate years. You know, nothing that ever amounted to a significant publication, but I was toying around with SVMs [support vector machines] for sepsis and working with the MIMIC [Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care] database early days and really just trying to understand what it meant that medical data was becoming digitized.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And at the same time, again, I was rather unsatisfied doing that purely in an academic context. And I so early craved seeing how this would roll out in the wild, roll out in a clinical setting that I would soon occupy. And that was really what drove me to work at this company called Kyruus [Health] and understand how these systems, you know, scaled. Obviously, that&#8217;s something with AI that we&#8217;re now grappling with in a real way because it looks much different.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Right. Yep.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: So the other experience I had, which is less relevant to AI, but I did do a summer in banking. And I mention this because what I learned in the experience was ‚Ä¶ it was a master class in business. And I learned that there was another scaling factor that I should appreciate as we think about medicine, and that was capital and business formation. And that was also something that could scale nonlinearly.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So when you married that with technology, it was, kind of, a natural segue for me before going to med school to think about venture capital and partnering with founders who were going to be building these technologies for the long term. And so that&#8217;s how I landed on the venture side.&nbsp;



LEE: And then how long of a break before you started your medical studies?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: It was about four years. Originally, it was going to be a two-year deferral, and the pandemic happened. Our space became quite active in terms of new companies and investment. So it was about four years before I went back.&nbsp;



LEE: I see. And so you&#8217;re in medical school. ChatGPT happened while you were in medical school, is that right?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. Right before I was studying for Step 1. So the funny story, Peter, that I like to share with folks is ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ I was just embarking on designing my Step 1 study plan with my mentor. And I went to NeurIPS [Conference] for the first time. And that was in 2022, when, of course, ChatGPT was released.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And for the remainder of that fall period, you know, I should have been studying for these shelf exams and, you know, getting ready ‚Ä¶&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ for this large board exam. And I was fortunate to partner, actually, with one of our portfolio company CEOs who is a physician‚Äîhe is an MD/PhD‚Äîto work on the first paper that showed that ChatGPT could pass the US Medical Licensing Exam (opens in new tab).&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: And that was a riveting experience for a number of reasons. I joke with folks that it was both the best paper I was ever, you know, a part of and proud to be a coauthor of, but also the worst for a lot of reasons that we could talk about.&nbsp;&nbsp;



It was the best in terms of canonical metrics like citations, but the worst in terms of, wow, did we spend six months as a field thinking this was the right benchmark ‚Ä¶ [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ for how to assess the performance of these models. And I&#8217;m so encouraged ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: You shouldn&#8217;t feel bad that way because, you know, at that time, I was secretly, you know, assessing what we now know of as GPT-4 in that period. And what was the first thing I tried to do? Step 1 medical exam.&nbsp;&nbsp;



By the way, just for our listeners who don&#8217;t understand about medical education‚Äîin the US, there&#8217;s a three-part exam that extends over a couple of years of medical school. Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. And Step 1 and Step 2 in particular are multiple-choice exams.&nbsp;



And they are very high stakes when you&#8217;re in medical school. And you really have to have a command of quite a lot of clinical knowledge to pass these. And it&#8217;s funny to hear you say what you were just sharing there because it was also the first impulse I had with GPT-4. And in retrospect, I feel silly about that.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I think many of us do, but I&#8217;ve been encouraged over the last two years, to your point, that we really have moved our discourse beyond these exams to thinking about more robust systems for the evaluation of performance, which becomes even more interesting as you and I have spoken about these multi-agent frameworks that we are now, you know, compelled to explore further.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. Well, and even though I know you&#8217;re a little sheepish about it now, I think in the show notes, we&#8217;ll link to that paper because it really was one of the seminal moments when we think about AI, AI in medicine.



And so you&#8217;re seeing this new technology, and it&#8217;s happening at a moment when you yourself have to confront taking the Step 1 exam. So how did that feel?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: It was humbling. It was shocking. What I had worked two years for, grueling over textbooks and, you know, flashcards and all of the things we do as medical students, to see a system emerge out of thin air that was arguably going to perform far better than I ever would, no matter how much ‚Ä¶&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ I was going to study for that exam, it set me back. It forced me to interrogate what my role in medicine would be. And it dramatically changed the specialties that I considered for myself long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I hope we talk about, you know, how I stumbled upon genetics and why I&#8217;m so excited about that field and its evolution in this computational landscape. I had to do a lot of soul searching to relinquish what I thought it meant to be a physician and how I would adapt in this new environment.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, one of the things that we wrote in our book, I think it was in a chapter that I contributed, I was imagining that students studying for Step 1 would be able to do it more actively.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Or you could even do sort of a pseudo-Step 3 exam by having a conversation. You provide the presentation of a patient and then have an encounter, you know, where the ChatGPT is the patient, and then you pretend to be the doctor.&nbsp;And then in the example that we published, then you say, ‚ÄúEnd of encounter.‚Äù And then you ask ChatGPT for an assessment of things.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So, you know, maybe it all came too late for Step 1 for you because you were already very focused and, you know, had your own kind of study framework. But did you have an influence or use of this kind of technology for Step 2 and Step 3?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: So even for Step 1, I would say, it [ChatGPT], you know, dropped in November. I took it [Step 1 exam] in the spring, so I was able to use it to study. But the lesson I learned in that moment, Peter, was really about the importance of trust with AI and clinicians or clinicians in training, because we all have the same resources that we use for these board exams, right. UWorld is this question bank. It&#8217;s been around forever. If you&#8217;re not using UWorld, like, good luck. And so why would you deviate off of a well-trodden path to study for this really important exam?&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so I kind of adjunctively used GPT alongside UWorld to come up with more personalized explanations for concepts that I wasn&#8217;t understanding, and I found that it was pretty good and it was certainly helpful for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Fortunately, I was, you know, able to pass, but I was very intentional about dogfooding AI when I was a medical student, and part of that was because I had been a venture capitalist, and I&#8217;d made investments in companies whose products I could actually use.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so, you know, Abridge is a company in the scribing space that you and I have talked about.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I was so fortunate in the early days of their product to not just be a user but to get to bring their product across the hospital. I could bring the product to the emergency department one week, to neurology another week, to the PICU [pediatric intensive care unit], you know, the next week, and assess the relative performance of, you know, how it handled really complex genetics cases ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ versus these very challenging social situations that you often find yourself navigating in primary care. So not only was I emotional about this technology, but I was a voracious adopter in the moment.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, right. And you had a financial interest then on top of that, right?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I was not paid by Abridge to use the product, but, you know, I joke that the team was probably sick of me. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



LEE: No, no, but you were working for a venture firm that was invested in these, right? So all of these things are wrapped up together. You know, you&#8217;re having to get licensed as a doctor while doing all of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I want to get into that investment and new venture stuff there, but let&#8217;s stick just for a few more minutes on medical education. So I mentioned, you know, what we wrote in the book, and I remember writing the example, you know, of an encounter. Is that at all realistic? Is anything like that ‚Ä¶ that was pure speculation on our part. What&#8217;s really happening?&nbsp;&nbsp;



And then after we talk about what&#8217;s really happening, what do you think should happen in medical education given the reality of generative AI?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised talking with my colleagues about AI in clinical settings, how curious people are and how curious they&#8217;ve been over the last two years. I think, oftentimes, we say, oh, you know, this technology really is stratified by age and the younger clinicians are using it more and the older physicians are ignoring it. And, you know, maybe that&#8217;s true in some regards, but I&#8217;ve seen, you know, many, you know, senior attendings pulling up Perplexity, GPT, more recently OpenEvidence (opens in new tab), which has been a really essential tool for me personally at the point of care, to come up with the best decisions for our patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;



The general skepticism arises when people reflect on their own experience in training and they think, ‚ÄúWell, I had to learn how to do it this way.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚ÄúAnd therefore, you using an AI scribe to document this encounter doesn&#8217;t feel right to me because I didn&#8217;t get to do that.‚Äù And I did face some of those critiques or criticisms, where you need to learn how to do it the old-school way first and then you can use an AI scribe.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I haven&#8217;t yet seen‚Äîmaybe even taking a step back‚ÄîI haven&#8217;t seen a lot of integration of AI into the core medical curriculum, period.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: And, as you know, if you want to add something to medical school curriculum, you can get in a long line of people who also want to do that.&nbsp;



LEE: Yes. Yeah.



CHEATHAM: But it is urgent that our medical schools do create formalized required trainings for this technology because people are already using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I think what we will need to determine is how much of the old way do people need to learn in order to earn the right to use AI at the point of care and how much of that old understanding, that prior experience, is essential to be able to assess the performance of these tools and whether or not they are having the intended outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I kind of joke it&#8217;s like learning cursive, right?&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I&#8217;m old enough to have had to learn cursive. I don&#8217;t think people really have to learn it these days. When do I use it? Well, when I&#8217;m signing something. I don&#8217;t even really sign checks anymore, but &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Well ‚Ä¶ the example I&#8217;ve used, which you&#8217;ve heard, is, I&#8217;m sure you were still taught the technique of manual palpation, even though ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Of course.&nbsp;



LEE: ‚Ä¶ you have access to technologies like ultrasound. And in fact, you would use ultrasound in many cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so I need to pin you down. What is your opinion on these things? Do you need to be trained in the old ways?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: When it comes to understanding the architecture of the medical note, I believe it is important for clinicians in training to know how that information is generated, how it&#8217;s characterized, and how to go from a very broad-reaching conversation to a distilled clinical document that serves many functions.&nbsp;



Does that mean that you should be forced to practice without an AI scribe for the entirety of your medical education? No. And I think that as you are learning the architecture of that document, you should be handed an AI scribe and you should be empowered to have visits with patients both in an analog setting‚Äîwhere you are transcribing and generating that note‚Äîand soon thereafter, I&#8217;m talking in a matter of weeks, working with an AI scribe. That&#8217;s my personal belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, yeah. So you&#8217;re going to &#8230; well, first off, congratulations on landing a residency at Boston Children&#8217;s [Hospital].&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Thank you, Peter.&nbsp;



LEE: I understand there were only two people selected for this and super competitive. You know, with that perspective, you know, how do you see your future in medicine, just given everything that&#8217;s happening with AI right now?&nbsp;&nbsp;



And are there things that you would urge, let&#8217;s say, the dean of the Brown Medical School to consider or to change? Or maybe not the dean of Brown but the head of the LCME [Liaison Committee on Medical Education], the accrediting body for US medical schools. What in your mind needs to change?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Sure. I&#8217;ll answer your first question first and then talk about the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: For me personally, I fell into the field of genomics. And so my training program will cover both pediatrics as well as clinical genetics and genomics.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I alluded to this earlier, but one of the reasons I&#8217;m so excited to join the field is because I really feel like the field of genetics not only is focused on a very underserved patient population, but not in how we typically think of underserved. I&#8217;m talking about underserved as in patients who don&#8217;t always have answers. Patients for whom the current guidelines don&#8217;t offer information or comfort or support.&nbsp;



Those are patients that are extremely underserved. And I think in this moment of AI, there&#8217;s a unique opportunity to utilize the computational systems that we now have access to, to provide these answers more precisely, more quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so I&#8217;m excited to marry those two fields. And genetics has long been a field that has adopted technology. We just think about the foundational technology of genomic sequencing and variant interpretation. And so it&#8217;s a kind of natural evolution of the field, I believe, to integrate AI and specifically generative AI.&nbsp;



If I were speaking directly to the LCME, I mean, I would just have to encourage the organization, as well as medical societies who partner with attending physicians across specialties, to lean in here.



When I think about prior revolutions in technology and medicine, physicians were not always at the helm. We have a unique opportunity now, and you talk about companies like Abridge in the AI space, companies like Viz.ai, Cleerly‚ÄîI mean, I could go on: Iterative Health ‚Ä¶ I could list 20 organizations that are bringing AI to the point of care that are founded by physicians.



This is our moment to have a seat at the table and to shape not only the discourse but the deployment. And the unique lens, of course, that a physician brings is that of prioritizing the patient, and with AI and this time around, we have to do that.



LEE: So LCME for our listeners is, I think it stands for the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (opens in new tab). It&#8217;s basically the accrediting body for US medical schools, and it&#8217;s very high stakes. It&#8217;s very, very rigorous, which I think is a good thing, but it&#8217;s also a bit of a straitjacket.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So if you are on the LCME, are there specific new curricular elements that you would demand that LCME, you know, add to its accreditation standards?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: We need to unbundle the different components of the medical appointment and think about the different functions of a human clinician to answer that question.&nbsp;&nbsp;



There are a couple of areas that are top of mind for me, the first being medical search. There are large organizations and healthcare incumbents that have been around for many decades, companies like UpToDate or even, you know, the guidelines that are housed by our medical societies, that need to respond to the information demands of clinicians at the point of care in a new way with AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so I would love to see our medical institutions teaching more students how to use AI for medical search problems at the point of care. How to not only, you know, from a prompt perspective, ask questions about patients in a high-efficacy way, but also to interpret the outputs of these systems to inform downstream clinical decision-making.&nbsp;&nbsp;



People are already adopting, as you know, GPT, OpenEvidence, Perplexity, all of these tools to make these decisions now.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so by not‚Äîagain, it&#8217;s a moral imperative of the LCME‚Äîby not having curriculum and support for clinicians doing that, we run the risk of folks not utilizing these tools properly but also to their greatest potential.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, then, but zooming forward then, what about board certification?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Board certification today is already transitioning to an open-book format for many specialties, is my understanding. And in talking to some of my fellow geneticists, who, you know, that&#8217;s a pretty challenging board exam in clinical genetics or biochemical genetics. They are using OpenEvidence during those open-book exams.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So what I would like to see us do is move from a system of rote memorization and regurgitation of fact to an assessment framework that is adaptive, is responsive, and assesses for your ability to use the tools that we now have at our disposal to make sound clinical decisions.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. We&#8217;ve heard from Sara Murray, you know, that when she&#8217;s doing her rounds, she consults routinely with ChatGPT. And that was something we also predicted, especially Carey Goldberg in our book, you know, wrote this fictional account.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Is that the primary real-world use of AI? Not only by clinicians, but also by medical students &#8230; are medical students, you know, engaged with ChatGPT or, you know, similar?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Absolutely. I&#8217;ve listed some of the tools. I think there, in general, Peter, there is this new clinician stack that is emerging of these tools that people are trying, and I think the cycles of iteration are quick, right. Some folks are using Claude [Claude.ai] one week, and they&#8217;re trying Perplexity, or they&#8217;re trying OpenEvidence, they&#8217;re trying GPT for a different task.¬†¬†



There&#8217;s this kind of moment in medicine that every clinician experiences where you&#8217;re on rounds, and there&#8217;s that very senior attending. And you&#8217;ve just presented a patient to them, and you think you did an elegant job, and you&#8217;ve summarized all the information, and you really feel good about your differential, and they ask you, like, the one question you didn&#8217;t think to address. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



And I&#8217;ll tell you, some of the funniest moments I&#8217;ve had using AI in the hospital has been, and let me take a step back, that process of an attending physician interrogating a medical student is called ‚Äúpimping,‚Äù for lack of a better phrase.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And some of the funniest use cases I&#8217;ve had for AI in that setting is actually using OpenEvidence or GPT as defense against pimping. [LAUGHTER] So quickly while they&#8217;re asking me the question, I put it in, and I&#8217;m actually able to answer it right away. So it&#8217;s been effective for that. But I would say, you know, [in] the halls of most of the hospitals where I&#8217;ve trained, I&#8217;m seeing this technology in the wild.



LEE: So now you&#8217;re so tech-forward, but that off-label use of AI, we also, when we wrote our book, we weren&#8217;t sure that at least top health systems would tolerate this. Do you have an opinion about this? Should these things be better regulated or controlled by the CIOs of Boston Children&#8217;s?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I&#8217;m a big believer that transparency encourages good behaviors.&nbsp;



And so the first time I actually tried to use ChatGPT in a clinical setting, it was at a hospital in Rhode Island. I will not name which hospital. But the site was actually blocked. I wasn&#8217;t able to access it from a desktop. That was the hospital&#8217;s first response to this technology was, let&#8217;s make sure none of our clinicians can access it. It has so much potential for medicine. The irony of that today.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And it&#8217;s since, you know, become unblocked. But I was able to use it on my phone. So, to your point, if there&#8217;s a will, there&#8217;s a way. And we will utilize this technology if we are seeing perceived value.&nbsp;



LEE: So, yeah, no, absolutely. So now, you know, in some discussions, one superpower that seems to be common across people who are really leading the charge here is they seem to be very good readers and students.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I understand you also as a voracious reader. In fact, you&#8217;re even on an editorial team for a major medical journal. To what extent does that help?&nbsp;&nbsp;



And then from your vantage point at New England Journal of Medicine AI‚Äîand I&#8217;ll have a chance to ask Zak Kohane as the editor in chief the same question‚Äîyou know, what&#8217;s your assessment as you reflect over the last two years for the submitted manuscripts? Are you overall surprised at what you&#8217;re seeing? Disappointed? Any kind of notable hits or misses, just in the steady stream of research papers that are getting submitted to that leading journal?&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: I would say overall, the field is becoming more expansive in the kinds of questions that people are asking.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Again, when we started, it was this very myopic approach of: ‚ÄúCan we pass these medical licensing exams? Can we benchmark this technology to how we benchmark our human clinicians?‚Äù I think that&#8217;s a trap. Some folks call this the Turing Trap, right, of let&#8217;s just compare everything to what a human is capable of.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Instead of interrogating what is the unique, as you all talk about in the book, what are the unique attributes of this new substrate for computation and what new behaviors emerge from it, whether that&#8217;s from a workflow perspective in the back office, or‚Äîas I&#8217;m personally more passionate and as we&#8217;re seeing more people focus on in the literature‚Äîwhat are the diagnostic capabilities, right.&nbsp;



I love Eric Topol&#8217;s framework for ‚Äúmachine eyes,‚Äù right, as this notion of like, yes, we as humans have eyes, and we have looked at medical images for many, many decades, but these machines can take a different approach to a retinal image, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



It&#8217;s not just what you can diagnose in terms of an ophthalmological disease but maybe a neurologic disease or, you know, maybe liver disease, right.&nbsp;



So I think the literature is, in general, moving to this place of expansion, and I&#8217;m excited by that.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, I kind of have referred to that as triangulation. You know, one of the things I think a trap that specialists in medicine can fall into, like a cardiologist will see everything in terms of the cardiac system. And ‚Ä¶ whereas a nephrologist will see things in a certain lens.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And one of the things that you oftentimes see in the responses from a large language model is that more expansive view. At the same time, you know, I wonder ‚Ä¶ we have medical specialties for good reason. And, you know, at times I do wonder, you know, if there can be confusion that builds up.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: This is an under-discussed area of AI‚ÄîAI collapses medical specialties onto themselves, right.&nbsp;



You have the canonical example of the cardiologist, you know, arguing that, you know, we should diuresis and maybe the nephrologist arguing that we should, you know, protect the kidneys. And how do two disciplines disagree on what is right for the patient when in theory, there is an objective best answer given that patient&#8217;s clinical status?&nbsp;



My understanding is that the emergence of medical specialties was a function of the cognitive overload of medicine in general and how difficult it was to keep all of the specifics of a given specialty in the mind. Of course, general practitioners are tasked with doing this at some level, but they&#8217;re also tasked with knowing when they&#8217;ve reached their limit and when they need to refer to a specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I&#8217;m interested in this question of whether medical specialties themselves need to evolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And if we look back in the history of medical technology, there are many times where a new technology forced a medical specialty to evolve, whether it was certain diagnostic tools that have been introduced or, as we&#8217;re seeing now with GLP-1s, the entire cardiometabolic field ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: ‚Ä¶ is having to really reimagine itself with these new tools. So I think AI will look very similar, and we should not hold on to this notion of classical medical specialties simply out of convention.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Right. All right. So now you&#8217;re starting your residency. You&#8217;re, you know, basically leading a charge in health and life sciences for a leading venture firm. I&#8217;d like you to predict what the world of healthcare is going to look like, you know, two years from now, five years from now, 10 years from now. And to frame that, to make it a little more specific, you know, what do you think will be possible that you, as a doctor and an investor, will be able to do two years from now, five years from now, 10 years from now that you can&#8217;t do today?&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Two years from now, I&#8217;m optimistic we&#8217;ll have greater adoption of AI by clinicians, both for back-office use cases. So whether that&#8217;s the scribe and the generation of the note for billing purposes, but also now thinking about that for patient-facing applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;



We&#8217;re already doing this with drafting of notes. I think we&#8217;ll see greater proliferation of those more obvious use cases over the next two years. And hopefully we&#8217;re seeing that across hospital systems, not just large well-funded academics, but really reaching our community hospitals, our rural hospitals, our under-resourced settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think hopefully we&#8217;ll see greater conversion. Right now, we have this challenge of ‚Äúpilotitis,‚Äù right. A lot of people are trying things, but the data shows that only one in three pilots are really converting to production use. So hopefully we&#8217;ll kind of move things forward that are working and pare back on those that are not.&nbsp;



We will not solve the problem of payment models in the next two years. That is a prediction I have.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Over the next five years, I suspect that, with the help of regulators, we will identify better payment mechanisms to support the adoption of AI because it cannot and will not sustain itself simply by asking health systems and hospitals to pay for it. That is not a scalable solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes. Right. Yep. In fact, I think there have to be new revenue-positive incentives if providers are asked to do more in the adoption of technology.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Absolutely. But as we appreciate, some of the most promising applications of AI have nothing to do with revenue. It might simply be providing a diagnosis to somebody, you know, for whom that might drive additional intervention, but may also not.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And we have to be OK with that because that&#8217;s the right thing to do. It&#8217;s our moral imperative as clinicians to implement this where it provides value to the patient.



Over the next 10 years, what I‚Äîagain, being a techno-optimist‚Äîam hopeful we start to see is a dissolving of the barrier that exists between care delivery and biomedical discovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;



This is the vision of the learning health system that was written over 10 years ago, and we have not realized it in practice. I&#8217;m a big proponent of ensuring that every single patient that enters our healthcare system not only receives the best care, but that we learn from the experiences of that individual to help the next.&nbsp;



And in our current system, that is not how it works. But, with AI, that now becomes possible.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, I think connecting healthcare experiences to medical discovery‚ÄîI think that that is really such a great vision for the future. And I do agree [that] AI really gives us real hope that we can make it true.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Morgan, I think we could talk for a few hours more. It&#8217;s just incredible what you&#8217;re up to nowadays. Thank you so much for this conversation. I&#8217;ve learned a lot talking to you.&nbsp;



CHEATHAM: Peter, thank you so much for your time. I will be clutching my signed copy of The AI Revolution in Medicine for many years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]&nbsp;



LEE: Morgan obviously is not an ordinary med school graduate. In previous episodes, one of the things we&#8217;ve seen is that people on the leading edge of real-world AI in medicine oftentimes are both practicing doctors as well as technology developers. Morgan is another example of this type of polymath, being both a med student and a venture capitalist.&nbsp;



One thing that struck me about Morgan is he&#8217;s just incredibly hands-on. He goes out, finds leading-edge tools and technologies, and often these things, even though they&#8217;re experimental, he takes them into his education and into his clinical experiences. I think this highlights a potentially important point for medical schools, and that is, it might be incredibly important to provide the support‚Äîand, let&#8217;s be serious, the permission‚Äîto students to access and use new tools and technologies. Indeed, the insight for me when I interact with Morgan is that in these early days of AI in medicine, there is no substitute for hands-on experimentation, and that is likely best done while in medical school.



Here&#8217;s my interview with Daniel Chen:&nbsp;



LEE: Daniel, it&#8217;s great to have you here.&nbsp;



DANIEL CHEN: Yeah, it&#8217;s a pleasure being here.&nbsp;



LEE: Well, you know, I normally get started in these conversations by asking, you know, how do you explain to your mother what you do all day? And the reason that that&#8217;s a good question is a lot of the people we have on this podcast have fancy titles and unusual jobs, but I&#8217;m guessing that your mother would have already a preconceived notion of what a medical student does. So I&#8217;d like to twist the question around a little bit for you and ask, what does your mother not realize about how you spend your days at school?&nbsp;&nbsp;



Or does she get it all right? [LAUGHS]&nbsp;



CHEN: Oh, no, she is very observant. I&#8217;ll say that off the bat. But I think something that she might not realize, is the amount of efforts spent, kind of, outside the classroom or outside the hospital. You know, she&#8217;s always, like, saying you have such long days in the hospital. You&#8217;re there so early in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But what she doesn&#8217;t realize is that maybe when I come back from the hospital, it&#8217;s not just like, oh, I&#8217;m done for the day. Let&#8217;s wind down, go to bed. But it&#8217;s more like, OK, I have some more practice questions I need to get through; I didn&#8217;t get through my studying. Let me write on, like wrap up this research project I&#8217;m working on, get that back to the PI [principal investigator]. It&#8217;s never ending to a certain extent. Those are some things she doesn&#8217;t realize.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, I think, you know, all the time studying, I think, is something that people expect of second-year medical students. And even nowadays at the top medical schools like this one, being involved in research is also expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think one thing that is a little unusual is that you are actually in clinic, as well, as a second-year student. How has that gone for you?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I mean, it&#8217;s definitely interesting. I would say I spend my time, especially this year, it&#8217;s kind of three things. There&#8217;s the preclinical stuff I&#8217;m doing. So that&#8217;s your classic, you know, you&#8217;re learning from the books, though I don&#8217;t feel like many of us do have textbooks anymore. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



There&#8217;s the clinical aspect, which you mentioned, which is we have an interesting model, longitudinal integrated clerkships. We can talk about that. And the last component is the research aspect, right. The extracurriculars.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I think starting out as a second year and doing your rotations, probably early on in, kind of, the clinical medical education, has been really interesting, especially with our format, because typically med students have two years to read up on all the material and, like, get some foundational knowledge. With us, it&#8217;s a bit more, we have maybe one year under our belt before we&#8217;re thrown into like, OK, go talk to this patient; they have ankle pain, right. But we might have not even started talking about ankle pain in class, right. Well, where do I begin?&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think starting out, it&#8217;s kind of, like, you know, the classic drinking from a fire hydrant. But you also, kind of, have that embarrassment of you&#8217;re talking to the patient like, I have no clue what&#8217;s happening [LAUGHTER] or you might have ‚Ä¶ my differentials all over the place, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I think the beauty of the longitudinal aspect is that now that we&#8217;re, like, in our last trimester, everything&#8217;s kind of coming together. Like, OK, I can start to see, you know, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re telling me. Here&#8217;s what the physical exam findings are. I&#8217;m starting to form a differential. Like, OK, I think these are the top three things.&nbsp;



But in addition to that, I think these are the next steps you should take so we can really focus and hone in on what exact diagnosis this might be.&nbsp;



LEE: All right. So, of course, what we&#8217;re trying to get into is about AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And, you know, the funny thing about AI and the book that Carey, Zak, and I wrote is we actually didn&#8217;t think too much about medical education, although we did have some parts of our book where we, well, first off, we made the guess that medical students would find AI to be useful. And we even had some examples, you know, where, you know, you would have a vignette of a mythical patient, and you would ask the AI to pretend to be that patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And then you would have an interaction and have to have an encounter. And so I want to delve into whether any of that is happening. How real it is. But before we do that, let&#8217;s get into first off, your own personal contact with AI. So let me start with a very simple question. Do you ever use generative AI systems like ChatGPT or similar?&nbsp;



CHEN: All the time, if not every day.&nbsp;



LEE: [LAUGHS] Every day, OK. And when did that start?&nbsp;



CHEN: I think when it first launched with GPT-3.5, I was, you know, curious. All my friends work in tech. You know, they&#8217;re either software engineers, PMs. They&#8217;re like, ‚ÄúHey, Daniel, take a look at this,‚Äù and at first, I thought it was just more of a glorified search engine. You know, I was actually looking back.&nbsp;&nbsp;



My first question to ChatGPT was, what was the weather going to be like the next week, you know? Something very, like, something easily you could have looked up on Google or your phone app, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I was like, oh, this is pretty cool. But then, kind of, fast-forwarding to, I think, the first instance I was using it in med school. I think the first, like, thing that really helped me was actually a coding problem. It was for a research project. I was trying to use SQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Obviously, I&#8217;ve never taken a SQL class in my life. So I asked Chat like, ‚ÄúHey, can you write me this code to maybe morph two columns together,‚Äù right? Something that might have taken me hours to maybe Google on YouTube or like try to read some documentation which just goes through my head.



But ChatGPT was able to, you know, not only produce the code, but, like, walk me through like, OK, you&#8217;re going to launch SQL. You&#8217;re going to click on this menu, [LAUGHTER] put the code in here, make sure your file names are correct. And it worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So it&#8217;s been a very powerful tool in that way in terms of, like, giving me expertise in something that maybe I traditionally had no training in.&nbsp;



LEE: And so while you&#8217;re doing this, I assume you had fellow students, friends, and others. And so what were you observing about their contact with AI? I assume you weren&#8217;t alone in this.&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, yeah, I think, &#8230; I&#8217;m not too sure in terms of what they were doing when it first came out, but I think if we were talking about present day, um, a lot of it&#8217;s kind of really spot on to what you guys talked about in the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Um, I think the idea around this personal tutor, personal mentor, is something that we&#8217;re seeing a lot. Even if we&#8217;re having in-class discussions, the lecturer might be saying something, right. And then I might be or I see a friend in ChatGPT or some other model looking up a question.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And you guys talked about, you know, how it can, like, explain a concept at different levels, right. But honestly, sometimes if there&#8217;s a complex topic, I ask ChatGPT, like, can you explain this to me as if I was a 6-year-old?&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. [LAUGHS]&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: Breaking down complex topics. Yeah. So I think it&#8217;s something that we see in the pre-clinical space, in lecture, but also even in the clinical space, there&#8217;s a lot of teaching, as well.&nbsp;



Sometimes if my preceptor is busy with patients, but I had maybe a question, I would maybe converse with ChatGPT, like, ‚ÄúHey, what are your thoughts about this?‚Äù Or, like, a common one is, like, medical doctors love to use abbreviations, ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: ‚Ä¶ and these abbreviations are sometimes only very niche and unique to their specialty, right. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



And I was reading this note from a urogynecologist. [In] the entire first sentence, I think there were, like, 10 abbreviations. Obviously, I compile lists and ask ChatGPT, like, ‚ÄúHey, in the context of urogynecology, can you define what these could possibly mean,‚Äù right? Instead of hopelessly searching in a Google or maybe, embarrassing, asking the preceptor. So in these instances, it&#8217;s played a huge role.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah. And when you&#8217;re doing things like that, it can make mistakes. And so what are your views of the reliability of generative AI, at least in the form of ChatGPT?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I think into the context of medicine, right, we fear a lot about the hallucinations that these models might have. And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m always checking for. When I talk with peers about this, we find it most helpful when the model gives us a source linking it back. I think the gold standard nowadays in medicine is using something called UpToDate (opens in new tab) that&#8217;s written by clinicians, for clinicians.&nbsp;



But sometimes searching on UpToDate can be a lot of time as well because it&#8217;s a lot of information to, like, sort through. But nowadays a lot of us are using something called OpenEvidence, which is also an LLM. But they always cite their citations with, like, published literature, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think being able to be conscious of the downfalls of these models and also being able to have the critical understanding of, like, analyzing the actual literature. I think double checking is just something that we&#8217;ve been also getting really good at.&nbsp;



LEE: How would you assess student attitudes‚Äîmed student attitudes‚Äîabout AI? Is it ‚Ä¶ the way you&#8217;re coming across is it&#8217;s just a natural part of life. But do people have firm opinions, you know, pro or con, when it comes to AI, and especially AI in medicine?&nbsp;



CHEN: I think it&#8217;s pretty split right now. I think there&#8217;s the half, kind of, like us, where we&#8217;re very optimistic‚Äîcautiously optimistic about, you know, the potential of this, right. It&#8217;s able to, you know, give us that extra information, of being that extra tutor, right. It&#8217;s also able to give us information very quickly, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I think the other flip side of what a lot of students hesitate to, which I agree, is this loss of the ability to critically think. Something that you can easily do is, you know, give these models, like, relevant information about the patient history and be like, ‚ÄúGive me a 10-list differential,‚Äù right.



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: And I think it&#8217;s very easy as a student to, you know, [say], ‚ÄúThis is difficult. Let me just use what the model says, and we&#8217;ll go with that,‚Äù right.&nbsp;



So I think being able to separate that, you know, medical school is a time where, you know, you&#8217;re learning to become a good doctor. And part of that requires the ability to be observant and critically think. Having these models simultaneously might hinder the ability to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEN: So I think, you know, the next step is, like, these models can be great‚Äîa great tool, absolutely wonderful. But how do you make sure that it&#8217;s not hindering these abilities to critically think?&nbsp;



LEE: Right. And so when you&#8217;re doing your LIC [longitudinal integrated clerkship] work, these longitudinal experiences, and you&#8217;re in clinic, are you pulling the phone out of your pocket and consulting with AI?&nbsp;



CHEN: Definitely. And I think my own policy for this, to kind of counter this, is that the night before when I&#8217;m looking over the patient list, the clinic [schedule] of who&#8217;s coming, I&#8217;m always giving it my best effort first.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Like, OK, the chief complaint is maybe just a runny nose for a kid in a pediatric clinic. What could this possibly be? Right? At this point, we&#8217;ve seen a lot. Like, OK, it could be URI [upper respiratory infection], it could be viral, it could be bacterial, you know, and then I go through the‚Äîyou know, I try to do my due diligence of, like, going through the history and everything like that, right.&nbsp;



But sometimes if it&#8217;s a more complex case, something maybe a presentation I&#8217;ve never seen before, I&#8217;ll still kind of do my best coming up with maybe a differential that might not be amazing. But then I&#8217;ll ask, you know, ChatGPT like, OK, in addition to these ideas, what do you think?&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEN: Am I missing something? You know, and usually, it gives a pretty good response.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, that particular idea is something that I think Carey, Zak, and I thought would be happening a lot more today than we&#8217;re observing. And it&#8217;s the idea of a second set of eyes on your work. And somehow, at least our observation is that that isn&#8217;t happening quite as much by today as we thought it might.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And it just seems like one of the really safest and most effective use cases. When you go and you&#8217;re looking at yourself and other fellow medical students, other second-year students, what do you see when it comes to the ‚Äúsecond set of eyes‚Äù idea?&nbsp;



CHEN: I think, like, a lot of students are definitely consulting ChatGPT in that regard because, you know, even in the very beginning, we&#8217;re taught to be, like, never miss these red flags, right. So these red flags are always on our differential, but sometimes, it can be difficult to figure out where to place them on that, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think in addition to, you know, coming up with these differentials, something I&#8217;ve been finding a lot of value [in] is just chatting with these tools to get their rationale behind their thinking, you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Something I find really helpful‚ÄîI think this is also a part of the, kind of, art of medicine‚Äîis figuring out what to order, right, what labs to order.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Right.



CHEN: Obviously, you have your order sets that automate some of the things, like in the ED [emergency department], or, like, there are some gold standard imaging things you should do for certain presentations.&nbsp;



But then you chat to, like, 10 different physicians on maybe the next steps after that, and they give you 10 different answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: But there&#8217;s never &#8230; I never understand exactly why. It&#8217;s always like, I&#8217;ve just been doing this for all my training, or that&#8217;s how I was taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So asking ChatGPT, like, ‚ÄúWhy would you do this next?‚Äù Or, like, ‚ÄúIs this a good idea?‚Äù And seeing the pros and cons has also been really helpful in my learning.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, wow, that&#8217;s super interesting. So now, you know, I&#8217;d like to get into the education you&#8217;re receiving. And, you know, I think it&#8217;s fair to say Kaiser Permanente is very progressive in really trying to be very cutting-edge in how the whole curriculum is set up.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And for the listeners who don&#8217;t know this, I&#8217;m actually on the board of directors of the school and have been since the founding of the school. And I think one of the reasons why I was invited to be on the board is the school really wanted to think ahead and be cutting edge when it comes to technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So from where I&#8217;ve sat, I&#8217;ve never been completely satisfied with the amount of tech that has made it into the curriculum. But at the same time, I&#8217;ve also made myself feel better about that just understanding that it&#8217;s sort of unstoppable, that students are so tech-forward already.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I wanted to delve into a little bit here into what your honest opinions are and your fellow students&#8217; opinions are about whether you feel like you&#8217;re getting adequate training and background formally as part of your medical education when it comes to things like artificial intelligence or other technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;



What do you think? Are you ‚Ä¶ would you wish the curriculum would change?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I think that&#8217;s a great question.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think from a tech perspective, the school is very good about implementing, you know, opportunities for us to learn. Like, for example, learning how to use Epic, right, or at Kaiser Permanente, what we call HealthConnect, right. These electronic health records. That, my understanding is, a lot of schools maybe don&#8217;t teach that.&nbsp;&nbsp;



That&#8217;s something where we get training sessions maybe once or twice a year, like, ‚ÄúHey, here&#8217;s how to make a shortcut in the environment,‚Äù right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think from that perspective, the school is really proactive in providing those opportunities, and they make it very easy to find resources for that, too. I think it &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, I think you&#8217;re pretty much guaranteed to be an Epic black belt by the time you [LAUGHS] finish your degree.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: Yes, yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But then I think in terms of the aspects of artificial intelligence, I think the school&#8217;s taken a more cautiously optimistic viewpoint. They&#8217;re just kind of looking around right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Formally in the curriculum, there hasn&#8217;t been anything around this topic. I believe the fourth-year students last year got a student-led lecture around this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But talking to other peers at other institutions, it looks like it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s very slowly being built into the curriculum, and it seems like a lot of it is actually student-led, you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;



You know, my friend at Feinberg [School of Medicine] was like we just got a session before clerkship about best practices on how to use these tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I have another friend at Pitt talking about how they‚Äôre leading efforts of maybe incorporating some sort of LLM into their in-house curriculum where students can, instead of clicking around the website trying to find the exact slide, they can just ask this tool, like, ‚ÄúOK. We had class this day. They talked about this &#8230; but can you provide more information?‚Äù and it can pull from that.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think a lot of this, a lot of it is student-driven. Which I think is really exciting because it begs the question, I think, you know current physicians may not be very well equipped with these tools as well, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;



So maybe they don&#8217;t have a good idea of what exactly is the next steps or what does the curriculum look like. So I think the future in terms of this AI curriculum is really student-led, as well.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think one of the reasons I think also that that happens is [that] it&#8217;s not just necessarily the curriculum that lags but the accreditation standards. You know, accreditation is really important for medical schools because you want to make sure that anyone who holds an MD, you know, is a bona fide doctor, and so accreditation standards are pretty strictly monitored in most countries, including the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I think accreditation standards are also‚Äîmy observation‚Äîare slow to understand how to adopt or integrate AI. And it&#8217;s not meant as a criticism. It&#8217;s a big unknown. No one knows exactly what to do and how to do. And so it&#8217;s really interesting to see that, as far as I can tell, I&#8217;ve observed the same thing that you just have seen, that most of the innovation in this area about how AI should be integrated into medical education is coming from the students themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;



It seems, I think, I&#8217;d like to think it&#8217;s a healthy development. [LAUGHS]



CHEN: Something tells me maybe the students are a bit better at using these tools, as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;



You know, I talk to my preceptors because KP [Kaiser Permanente] also has their own version ‚Ä¶&nbsp;



LEE: Preceptor, maybe we should explain what that is.&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, sorry. So a preceptor is an attending physician, fully licensed, finished residency, and they are essentially your kind of teacher in the clinical environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So KP has their own version of some ambient documentation device, as well. And something I always like to ask, you know, like, ‚ÄúHey, what are your thoughts on these tools,‚Äù right?&nbsp;&nbsp;



And it&#8217;s always so polarizing, as well, even among the same specialty. Like, if you ask psychiatrists, which I think is a great use case of these tools, right. My preceptor hates it. Another preceptor next door loves it. [LAUGHTER]&nbsp;



So I think a lot of it‚Äôs, like, it‚Äôs still, like, a lot of unknowns, like you were mentioning.&nbsp;



LEE: Right. Well, in fact, I&#8217;m glad you brought that up because one thing that we&#8217;ve been hearing from previous guests a lot when it comes to AI in clinic is about ambient listening by AI, for example, to help set up a clinical note or even write a clinical note.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And another big use case that we heard a lot about that seems to be pretty popular is the use of generative AI to respond to patient messages.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So let&#8217;s start with the clinical note thing. First off, do you have opinions about that technology?&nbsp;



CHEN: I think it&#8217;s definitely good.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think especially where, you know, if you&#8217;re in the family medicine environment or pediatric environment where you&#8217;re spending so much time with patients, a note like that is great, right.&nbsp;



I think coming from a strictly medical student standpoint, I think it&#8217;s‚Äîhonestly, it&#8217;d be great to have‚Äîbut I think there&#8217;s a lot of learning when you write the note, you know. There&#8217;s a lot of, you know, all of my preceptors talk about, like, when I read your note, you should present it in a way where I can see your thoughts and then once I get to the assessment and plan, it&#8217;s kind of funneling down towards a single diagnosis or a handful of diagnoses. And that&#8217;s, I think, a skill that requires you to practice over time, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So a part of me thinks, like, if I had this tool where [it] can just automatically give me a note as a first year, then it takes away from that learning experience, you know.&nbsp;



Even during our first year throughout school, we frequently get feedback from professors and doctors about these notes. And it&#8217;s a lot of feedback. [LAUGHTER] It&#8217;s like, ‚ÄúI don&#8217;t think you should have written that,‚Äù ‚ÄúThat should be in this section ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ you know, like a medical note or a SOAP note [Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan], where, you know, the subjective is, like, what the patient tells you. Objective is what the physical findings are, and then your assessment of what&#8217;s happening, and then your plan. Like, it&#8217;s very particular, and then I think medicine is so structured in a way, that&#8217;s kind of, like, how everyone does it, right. So kind of going back to the question, I think it&#8217;s a great tool, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s appropriate for a medical student.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, it&#8217;s so interesting to hear you say that. I was ‚Ä¶ one of our previous guests is the head of R&amp;D at Epic, Seth Hain. He said, ‚ÄúYou know, Peter, doctors do a lot of their thinking when they write the note.‚Äù&nbsp;



And, of course, Epic is providing ambient, you know, clinical notetaking automation. But he was urging caution because, you know, you&#8217;re saying, well, this is where you&#8217;re learning a lot. But actually, it&#8217;s also a point where, as a doctor, you&#8217;re thinking about the patient. And we do probably have to be careful with how we automate parts of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;



All right. So you&#8217;re gearing up for Step 1 of the USMLE [United States Medical Licensing Examination]. That&#8217;ll be a big multiple-choice exam. Then Step 2 is similar: very, very focused on advanced clinical knowledge. And then Step 3, you know, is a little more interactive.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so one question that people have had about AI is, you know, how do we regulate the use of AI in medicine? And one of the famous papers that came out of both academia and industry was the concept that you might be able to treat AI like a person and have it go through the same licensing. And this is something that Carey, Zak, and I contemplated in our book.&nbsp;&nbsp;



In the end, at the time we wrote the book, I personally rejected the idea, but I think it&#8217;s still alive. And so I‚Äôve wondered if you have any &#8230; you know, first off, are you opinionated at all about, what should the requirements be for the allowable use of AI in the kind of work that you&#8217;re going to be doing?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a tough question because, like, where do you draw that line, right? If you apply the human standards of it&#8217;s passing exams, then yes, in theory, it could be maybe a medical doctor, as well, right? It&#8217;s more empathetic than medical doctors, right? So where do you draw that line?&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think, you know, part of me thinks it&#8217;s maybe it is that human aspect that patients like to connect with, right. And maybe this really is just, like, these tools are just aids in helping, you know, maybe load off some cognitive load, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I think the other part of me, I&#8217;m thinking about this is the next generation who are growing up with this technology, right. They&#8217;re interacting with applications all day. Maybe they&#8217;re on their iPads. They&#8217;re talking to chatbots. They&#8217;re using ChatGPT. This is, kind of, the environment they grew up with. Does that mean they also have increased, like, trust in these tools that maybe our generation or the generations above us don&#8217;t have that value that human connection? Would they value human connection less?&nbsp;&nbsp;



You know, I think those are some troubling thoughts that, you know, yes, at end of the day, maybe I&#8217;m not as smart as these tools, but I can still provide that human comfort. But if, at the end of the day, the future generation doesn&#8217;t really care about that or they perfectly trust these tools because that&#8217;s all they&#8217;ve kind of known, then where do human doctors stand?&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think part of that is, there would be certain specialties where maybe the human connection is more important. The longitudinal aspect of building that trust, I think is important. Family medicine is a great example. I think hematology oncology with cancer treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Obviously, I think anyone&#8217;s not going to be thrilled to hear cancer diagnosis, but something tells me that seeing that on a screen versus maybe a physician prompting you and telling you about that tells me that maybe in those aspects, you know, the human nature, the human touch plays an important role there, too.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, you know, I think it strikes me that it&#8217;s going to be your generation that really is going to set the pattern probably for the next 50 years about how this goes. And it&#8217;s just so interesting because I think a lot will depend on your reactions to things.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So, for example, you know, one thing that is already starting to happen are patients who are coming in armed, you know, with a differential [LAUGHS], you know, that they&#8217;ve developed themselves with the help of ChatGPT. So let me &#8230; you must have thought about these things. So, in fact, has it happened in your clinical work already?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen people come into the ED during my ED shift, like emergency department, and they‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄúOh, I have neck pain and here are all the things that, you know, Chat told me, ChatGPT told me. What do you think &#8230; do I need? I want this lab ordered, that lab ordered.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Right.&nbsp;



CHEN: And I think my initial reaction is, ‚ÄúGreat. Maybe we should do that.‚Äù But I think the other reaction is understanding that not everyone has the clinical background of understanding what&#8217;s most important, what do we need to absolutely rule out, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;



So, I think in some regards, I would think that maybe ChatGPT errs on the side of caution, &#8230;&nbsp;



LEE: Yes.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: &#8230; giving maybe patients more extreme examples of what this could be just to make sure that it&#8217;s, in a way, is not missing any red flags as well, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Right. Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;



CHEN: But I think a lot of this is ‚Ä¶ what we&#8217;ve been learning is it&#8217;s all about shared decision making with the patient, right. Being able to acknowledge like, ‚ÄúYeah, [in] that list, most of the stuff is very plausible, but maybe you didn&#8217;t think about this one symptom you have.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think part of it, maybe it&#8217;s a sidebar here, is the idea of prompting, right. You know, they&#8217;ve always talked about all these, you know, prompt engineers, you know, how well can you, like, give it context to answer your question?&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEN: So I think being able to give these models the correct information and the relevant information and keyword relevant, because relevant is, I guess, where your clinical expertise comes in. Like, what do you give the model, what do you not give? So I think that difference between a medical provider versus maybe your patients is ultimately the difference.&nbsp;



LEE: Let me press on that a little bit more because you brought up the issue of trust, and trust is so essential for patients to feel good about their medical care.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I can imagine you&#8217;re a medical student seeing a patient for the first time. So you don&#8217;t have a trust relationship with that patient. And the patient comes in maybe trusting ChatGPT more than you.&nbsp;



CHEN: Very valid. No. I mean, I get that a lot, surprisingly, you know. [LAUGHTER] Sometimes [they‚Äôre] like, ‚ÄúOh, I don&#8217;t want to see the medical student,‚Äù because we always give the patient an option, right. Like, it&#8217;s their time, whether it&#8217;s a clinic visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But yeah, those patients, I think it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable. If I heard a second-year medical student was going to be part of my care team, taking that history, I&#8217;d be maybe a little bit concerned, too. Like, are they asking all the right questions? Are they relaying that information back to their attending physician correctly?&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think a lot of it is, at least from a medical student perspective, is framing it so the patient understands that this is a learning opportunity for the students. And something I do a lot is tell them like, ‚ÄúHey, like, you know, at the end of the day, there is someone double-checking all my work.‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah.&nbsp;



CHEN: But for those that come in with a list, I sometimes sit down with them, and we&#8217;ll have a discussion, honestly.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I‚Äôll be like, ‚ÄúI don&#8217;t think you have meningitis because you&#8217;re not having a fever. Some of the physical exam maneuvers we did were also negative. So I don&#8217;t think you have anything to worry about that,‚Äù you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I think it&#8217;s having that very candid conversation with the patient that helps build that initial trust. Telling them like, ‚ÄúHey ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù&nbsp;



LEE: It&#8217;s impressive to hear how even keeled you are about this. You know, I think, of course, and you&#8217;re being very humble saying, well, you know, as a second-year medical student, of course, someone might not, you know, have complete trust. But I think that we will be entering into a world where no doctor is going to be, no matter how experienced or how skilled, is going to be immune from this issue.&nbsp;



So we&#8217;re starting to run toward the end of our time together. And I like to end with one or two more provocative questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And so let me start with this one. Undoubtedly, I mean, you&#8217;re close enough to tech and digital stuff, digital health, that you&#8217;re undoubtedly familiar with famous predictions, you know, by Turing and Nobel laureates that someday certain medical specialties, most notably radiology, would be completely supplanted by machines. And more recently, there have been predictions by others, like, you know, Elon Musk, that maybe even some types of surgery would be replaced by machines.&nbsp;&nbsp;



What do you think? Do you have an opinion?&nbsp;



CHEN: I think replace is a strong term, right. To say that doctors are completely obsolete, I think, is unlikely.&nbsp;&nbsp;



If anything, I think there might be a shift maybe in what it means to be a doctor, right. Undoubtedly, maybe the demands of radiologists are going to go down because maybe more of the simple things can truly be automated, right. And you just have a supervising radiologist whose output is maybe 10 times as maybe 10 single radiologists, right.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So I definitely see a future where the demand of certain specialties might go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;



And I think when I talk about a shift of what it means to be a physician, maybe it&#8217;s not so much diagnostic anymore, right, if these models get so good at, like, just taking in large amounts of information, but maybe it pivots to being really good at understanding the limitations of these models and knowing when to intervene is what it means to be the kind of the next generation of physicians.&nbsp;&nbsp;



I think in terms of surgery, yeah, I think it&#8217;s a concern, but maybe not in the next 50 years. Like those Da Vinci robots are great. I think out of Mayo Clinic, they were demoing some videos of these robots leveraging computer vision to, like, close portholes, like laparoscopic scars. And that&#8217;s something I do in the OR [operating room], right. And we&#8217;re at the same level at this point. [LAUGHTER] So at that point, maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp;



But I think robotics still has to address the understanding of like, what if something goes wrong, right? Who&#8217;s responsible? And I don&#8217;t see a future where a robot is able to react to these, you know, dangerous situations when maybe something goes wrong. You still have to have a surgeon on board to, kind of, take over. So in that regard, that&#8217;s kind of where I see maybe the future going.&nbsp;



LEE: So last question. You know, when you are thinking about the division of time, one of the themes that we&#8217;ve seen in the previous guests is more and more doctors are doing more technology work, like writing code and so on. And more and more technologists are thinking deeply and getting educated in clinical and preclinical work.&nbsp;&nbsp;



So for you, let&#8217;s look ahead 10 years. What do you see your division of labor to be? Or, you know, how would you ‚Ä¶ what would you tell your mom then about how you spend a typical day?&nbsp;



CHEN: Yeah, I mean, I think for me, technology is something I definitely want to be involved in in my line of work, whether it&#8217;s, you know, AI work, whether it&#8217;s improving quality of healthcare through technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;



My perfect division would be maybe still being able to see patients but also balancing some maybe more of these higher-level kind of larger projects. But I think having that division would be something nice.&nbsp;



LEE: Yeah, well, I think you would be great just from the little bit I know about you. And, Daniel, it&#8217;s been really great chatting with you. I wish you the best of luck, you know, with your upcoming exams and getting past this year two of your medical studies. And perhaps someday I&#8217;ll be your patient.&nbsp;



[TRANSITION MUSIC]‚ÄØ&nbsp;



CHEN: Thank you so much.&nbsp;



LEE: You know, one of the lucky things about my job is that I pretty regularly get to talk to students at all levels, spanning high school to graduate school. And when I get to talk especially to med students, I&#8217;m always impressed with their intelligence, just how serious they are, and their high energy levels. Daniel is absolutely a perfect example of all that.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Now, it comes across as trite to say that the older generation is less adept at technology adoption than younger people. But actually, there probably is a lot of truth to that. And in the conversation with Daniel, I think he was actually being pretty diplomatic but also clear that he and his fellow med students don&#8217;t necessarily expect the professors in their med school to understand AI as well as they do.&nbsp;



There&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that medical education will have to evolve a lot to help prepare doctors and nurses for an AI future. But where will this evolution come from?&nbsp;&nbsp;



As I reflect on my conversations with Morgan and Daniel, I start to think that it&#8217;s most likely to come from the students themselves. And when you meet people like Morgan and Daniel, it&#8217;s impossible to not be incredibly optimistic about the next generation of clinicians.&nbsp;



[THEME MUSIC]&nbsp;



Another big thank-you to Morgan and Daniel for taking time to share their experiences with us. And to our listeners, thank you for joining us. We have just a couple of episodes left, one on AI‚Äôs impact on the operation of public health departments and healthcare systems and another coauthor roundtable. We hope you&#8217;ll continue to tune in.&nbsp;&nbsp;



Until next time.&nbsp;

‚Ä¢ Xinxing Xu bridges AI research and real-world impact at Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore
  AI has made remarkable progress in recent years, but turning experimental models into tools that work in the real world is still a major challenge. Bridging this gap between innovation and application has shaped the career of Xinxing Xu, principal researcher at Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore, and underpins the mission of the lab‚Äôs newly established presence in the region.



Xinxing Xu, Principal Researcher, Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore



‚ÄúInnovative algorithms can only demonstrate their true value when tested with real-world data and in actual scenarios, where they can be continuously optimized through iteration,‚Äù he says.



Xu‚Äôs commitment to balancing algorithmic innovation with practical application has shaped his entire career. During his PhD studies at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Xu focused on emerging technologies like multiple kernel learning methods and multimodal machine learning. Today he‚Äôs applying these techniques to real-world use cases like image recognition and video classification.



After completing his doctorate, he joined the Institute of High Performance Computing at Singapore‚Äôs Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), where he worked on interdisciplinary projects ranging from medical image recognition to AI systems for detecting defects on facade of buildings.

Bringing cross-domain expertise to AI‚Äôs real-world frontiers



As a key hub in Microsoft Research‚Äôs network across Asia, the Singapore lab is guided by a three-part mission: to drive industry-transforming AI deployment, pursue fundamental breakthroughs in the field, and promote responsible, socially beneficial applications of the technology.



To reach these goals, Xu and his colleagues are working closely with local collaborators, combining cross-disciplinary expertise to tackle complex, real-world challenges.



To deliver on that mission, Xinxing Xu and his colleagues are working closely with local collaborators, drawing on cross-disciplinary expertise to solve real-world problems. One key focus is healthcare, where Xu leads a collaboration with Singapore‚Äôs SingHealth to explore how AI can support precision medicine. By combining SingHealth‚Äôs clinical data with advanced AI models, the team aims to deliver more personalized analyses and sharper diagnostic tools‚Äîlaying the groundwork for improved patient outcomes.&nbsp;



Beyond healthcare, the team is also targeting key sectors like finance and logistics. By developing domain-specific foundation models and AI agents, they aim to support smarter decision-making and accelerate digital transformation across industries. ‚ÄúSingapore has a strong foundation in these sectors,‚Äù Xu notes, ‚Äúmaking it an ideal environment for technology validation and iteration.‚Äù



The team is also partnering with leading academic institutions, including the National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), to advance the field of spatial intelligence. Their goal is to develop embodied intelligence systems capable of carrying out complex tasks in smart environments.



As AI becomes more deeply embedded in everyday life, researchers at the Singapore lab are also increasingly focused on what they call ‚Äúsocietal AI‚Äù‚Äîbuilding AI systems that are culturally relevant and trustworthy within Southeast Asia‚Äôs unique cultural and social contexts. In collaboration with global colleagues, they‚Äôre helping to advance a more culturally grounded and responsible approach to AI research in the region.



Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore: Expanding global reach, connecting regional innovation&nbsp;



Realizing AI‚Äôs full potential requires more than technical breakthroughs. It also depends on collaboration‚Äîacross industries, academia, and policy. Only through this intersection of forces can AI move beyond the lab to deliver meaningful societal value.&nbsp;



Singapore‚Äôs strengths in science, engineering, and digital governance make it an ideal setting for this kind of work. Its collaborative culture, robust infrastructure, international talent pool, and strong policy support for science and technology make it fertile ground for interdisciplinary research.&nbsp;



This is why Microsoft Research Asia continues to collaborate closely with Singapore‚Äôs top universities, research institutions, and industry partners. These partnerships support joint research, talent development, and technical exchange. Building on this foundation, Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore will further deepen its collaboration with NUS, NTU Singapore, and Singapore Management University (SMU) to advance both fundamental and applied research, while equipping the next generation of researchers with real-world experience. In addition, Microsoft Research Asia is fostering academic exchange and strengthening the research ecosystem through summer schools and joint workshops with NUS, NTU Singapore, and SMU.&nbsp;



The launch of the Singapore lab further marks an important step in expanding the company‚Äôs global research footprint, serving as a bridge between regional innovation and Microsoft‚Äôs global ecosystem. Through its integrated lab network, Microsoft Research fosters the sharing of technologies, methods, and real-world insights, creating a virtuous cycle of innovation.



‚ÄúWe aim to build a research hub in Singapore that is globally connected and deeply rooted in the local ecosystem,‚Äù Xu says. ‚ÄúMany breakthroughs come from interdisciplinary and cross-regional collaboration. By breaking boundaries‚Äîacross disciplines, industries, and geographies‚Äîwe can drive research that has lasting impact.‚Äù



As AI becomes more deeply woven into industry and everyday life, Xu believes that meaningful research must be closely connected to regional development and social well-being. ‚ÄúMicrosoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore is a future-facing lab,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhile we push technological frontiers, we‚Äôre equally committed to the responsibility of technology‚Äîensuring AI can help address society‚Äôs most pressing challenges.‚Äù



In a world shaped by global challenges, Xu sees collaboration and innovation as essential to real progress. With Singapore as a launchpad, he and his team are working to extend AI‚Äôs impact and value across Southeast Asia and beyond.

Three essential strengths for the next generation of AI researchers



AI‚Äôs progress depends not only on technical breakthroughs but also on the growth and dedication of talent. At Microsoft Research Asia, there is a strong belief that bringing research into the real world requires more than technical coordination‚Äîit depends on unlocking the full creativity and potential of researchers.



In Singapore‚Äîa regional innovation hub that connects Southeast Asia‚ÄîXu and his colleagues are working to push AI beyond the lab and into fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing. For young researchers hoping to shape the future of AI, this is a uniquely powerful stage.



To help guide the next generation, Xu shares three pieces of advice:




Build a strong foundation ‚Äì ‚ÄúCore knowledge in machine learning, linear algebra, and probability and statistics is the bedrock of AI research,‚Äù Xu says. ‚ÄúA solid theoretical base is essential to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving field. Even today‚Äôs hottest trends in generative AI rely on longstanding principles of optimization and model architecture design.‚Äù While code generation tools are on the rise, Xu emphasizes that mathematical fundamentals remain essential for understanding and innovating in AI.



Understand real-world applications ‚Äì Technical skills alone aren‚Äôt enough. Xu encourages young researchers to deeply engage with the problems they‚Äôre trying to solve. Only by tightly integrating technology with its context can researchers create truly valuable solutions.‚ÄúIn healthcare, for example, researchers may need to follow doctors in clinics to gain a true understanding of clinical workflows. That context helps identify the best entry points for AI deployment. Framing research problems around real-world needs is often more impactful than just tuning model parameters,‚Äù Xu says.



Develop interdisciplinary thinking ‚Äì Cross-disciplinary collaboration is becoming essential to AI innovation. Xu advises young researchers to learn how to work with experts from other fields to explore new directions together. ‚ÄúThese kinds of interactions often spark fresh, creative ideas,‚Äù he says.Maintaining curiosity is just as important. ‚ÄúBeing open to new technologies and fields is what enables researchers to continually break new ground and produce original results.‚Äù




Xu extends an open invitation to aspiring researchers from all backgrounds to join Microsoft Research Asia ‚Äì Singapore. ‚ÄúWe offer a unique platform that blends cutting-edge research with real-world impact,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a place where you can work on the frontiers of AI‚Äîand see how your work can help transform industries and improve lives.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ Technical approach for classifying human-AI interactions at scale
  As large language models (LLMs) become foundational to modern AI systems, the ability to run them at scale‚Äîefficiently, reliably, and in near real-time‚Äîis no longer a nice-to-have. It‚Äôs essential. The Semantic Telemetry project tackles this challenge by applying LLM-based classifiers to hundreds of millions of sampled, anonymized Bing Chat conversations each week. These classifiers extract signals like user expertise, primary topic, and satisfaction, enabling deeper insight into human-AI interactions and driving continuous system improvement.



But building a pipeline that can handle this volume isn‚Äôt just about plugging into an API. It requires a high-throughput, high-performance architecture that can orchestrate distributed processing, manage token and prompt complexity, and gracefully handle the unpredictability of remote LLM endpoints.



In this latest post in our series on Semantic Telemetry, we‚Äôll walk through the engineering behind that system‚Äîhow we designed for scale from the start, the trade-offs we made, and the lessons we learned along the way. From batching strategies and token optimization and orchestration, we‚Äôll share what it takes to build a real-time LLM classification pipeline.

System architecture highlights



The Semantic Telemetry pipeline (opens in new tab) is a highly-scalable, highly-configurable, data transformation pipeline. While it follows a familiar ETL structure, several architectural innovations make it uniquely suited for high-throughput LLM integration:




Hybrid compute engineThe pipeline combines the distributed power of‚ÄØPySpark‚ÄØwith the speed and simplicity of‚ÄØPolars, enabling it to scale across large datasets or run lightweight jobs in Spark-less environments‚Äîwithout code changes.



LLM-centric transformation layerAt the core of the pipeline is a multi-stage transformation process tailored for running across multiple LLM endpoints such that:

Runs model agnostic. Provides a generic interface for LLMs and adopts model specific interfaces built from a generic interface.



Prompt templates are defined using the Prompty language specification for consistency and reuse, with options for users to include custom prompts.



Parsing and cleaning logic ensures structured, schema-aligned outputs, even when LLM responses are imperfect such as removing extra characters in output, resolving not-exact label matches (i.e. ‚Äúcreate‚Äù versus ‚Äúcreated‚Äù) and relabeling invalid classifications.






Figure 1. Architecture diagram



The pipeline supports multiple classification tasks (e.g., user expertise, topic, satisfaction) through modular prompt templates and configurable execution paths‚Äîmaking it easy to adapt to new use cases or environments.



Engineering challenges & solutions



Building a high-throughput, LLM-powered classification pipeline at scale introduced a range of engineering challenges‚Äîfrom managing latency and token limits to ensuring system resilience. Below are the key hurdles we encountered and how we addressed them.



LLM endpoint latency & variability



Challenge: LLM endpoints, especially those hosted remotely (e.g., Azure OpenAI), introduce unpredictable latency due to model load, prompt complexity, and network variability. This made it difficult to maintain consistent throughput across the pipeline.



Solution: We implemented a combination of:




Multiple Azure OpenAI endpoints in rotation to increase throughput and distribute workload. We can analyze throughput and redistribute as needed.



Saving output in intervals to write data asynchronously in case of network errors.



Utilizing models with higher tokens per minute (TPM) such as OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o mini. GPT-4o mini had a 2M TPM limit which is a 25x throughput increase from GPT-4 (80K TPM -> 2M TPM)



Timeouts and retries with exponential backoff.




Evolving LLM models & prompt alignment



Challenge: Each new LLM release‚Äîsuch as Phi, Mistral, DeepSeek, and successive generations of GPT (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o)‚Äîbrings improvements, but also subtle behavioral shifts. These changes can affect classification consistency, output formatting, and even the interpretation of prompts. Maintaining alignment with baseline expectations across models became a moving target.



Solution: We developed a model evaluation workflow to test prompt alignment across LLM versions:




Small-sample testing: We ran the pipeline on a representative sample using the new model and compared the output distribution to a known baseline.



Distribution analysis: If the new model‚Äôs output aligned closely, we scaled up testing. If not, we iteratively‚ÄØtuned the prompts‚ÄØand re-ran comparisons.



Interpretation flexibility: We also recognized that a shift in distribution isn‚Äôt always a regression. Sometimes it reflects a more accurate or nuanced classification, especially as models improve.




To support this process, we used tools like Sammo (opens in new tab), which allowed us to compare outputs across multiple models and prompt variants. This helped us quantify the impact of prompt changes and model upgrades and make informed decisions about when to adopt a new model or adjust our classification schema.



Dynamic concurrency scaling for LLM calls



Challenge: LLM endpoints frequently encounter rate limits and inconsistent response times under heavy usage. The models&#8217; speeds can also vary, complicating the selection of optimal concurrency levels. Furthermore, users may choose suboptimal settings due to lack of familiarity, and default concurrency configurations are rarely ideal for every situation. Dynamic adjustments based on throughput, measured in various ways, can assist in determining optimal concurrency levels.



Solution: We implemented a dynamic concurrency control mechanism that proactively adjusts the number of parallel LLM calls based on real-time system behavior:




External task awareness: The system monitors the number of parallel tasks running across the pipeline (e.g., Spark executors or async workers) and uses this to inform the initial concurrency level.



Success/failure rate monitoring: The system tracks the rolling success and failure rates of LLM calls. A spike in failures triggers a temporary reduction in concurrency, while sustained success allows for gradual ramp-up.



Latency-based feedback loop: Instead of waiting for rate-limit errors, measure the‚ÄØresponse time‚ÄØof LLM calls. If latency increases, reduce concurrency; if latency decreases and success rates remain high, cautiously scale up.

Optimization experiments



To further improve throughput and efficiency, we ran a series of optimization experiments. Each approach came with trade-offs that we carefully measured.



Batch endpoints (Azure/OpenAI)



Batch endpoints are a cost-effective, moderately high-throughput way of executing LLM requests. Batch endpoints process large lists of LLM prompts over a 24-hour period, recording responses in a file. They are about 50% cheaper than non-batch endpoints and have separate token limits, enabling increased throughput when used alongside regular endpoints. However, they require at least 24 hours to complete requests and provide lower overall throughput compared to non-batch endpoints, making them unsuitable for situations needing quick results.



Conversation batching in prompts during pipeline runtime



Batching multiple conversations for classification at once can significantly increase throughput and reduce token usage, but it may impact the accuracy of results. In our experiment with a domain classifier, classifying 10 conversations simultaneously led to an average of 15-20% of domain assignments changing between repeated runs of the same prompt. To address this, one mitigation approach is to use a grader LLM prompt: first classify the batch, then have the LLM identify any incorrectly classified conversations, and finally re-classify those as needed. While batching offers efficiency gains, it is important to monitor for potential drops in classification quality.



Combining classifiers in a single prompt



Combining multiple classifiers into a single prompt increases throughput by allowing one call to the LLM instead of multiple calls. This not only multiplies the overall throughput by the number of classifiers processed but also reduces the total number of tokens used, since the conversation text is only passed in once. However, this approach may compromise classification accuracy, so results should be closely monitored.



Classification using text embeddings



An alternative approach is to train custom neural network models for each classifier using only the text embeddings of conversations. This method delivers both cost and time savings by avoiding making multiple LLM requests for every classifier and conversation‚Äîinstead, the system only needs to request conversation text embeddings once and can reuse these embeddings across all classifier models.



For example, starting with a set of conversations to validate and test the new model, run these conversations through the original prompt-based classifier to generate a set of golden classifications, then obtain text embeddings (using a tool like text-embedding-3-large) for each conversation. These embeddings and their corresponding classifications are used to train a model such as a multi-layer perceptron. In production, the workflow involves retrieving the text embedding for each conversation and passing it through the trained model; if there is a model for each classifier, a single embedding retrieval per conversation suffices for all classifiers.



The benefits of this approach include significantly increased throughput and cost savings‚Äîsince it‚Äôs not necessary to call the LLM for every classifier and conversation. However, this setup can require GPU compute which can increase costs and infrastructure complexity, and the resulting models may not achieve the same accuracy as prompt-based classification methods.



Prompt compression



Compressing prompts by eliminating unnecessary tokens or by using a tool such as LLMLingua (opens in new tab) to automate prompt compression can optimize classification prompts either ahead of time or in real-time. This approach increases overall throughput and results in cost savings due to a reduced number of tokens, but there are risks: changes to the classifier prompt or conversation text may impact classification accuracy, and depending on the compression technique, it could even decrease throughput if the compression process takes longer than simply sending uncompressed text to the LLM.



Text truncation



Truncating conversations to a specific length limits the overall number of tokens sent through an endpoint, offering cost savings and increased throughput like prompt compression. By reducing the number of tokens per request, throughput rises because more requests can be made before reaching the endpoint‚Äôs tokens-per-minute (TPM) limit, and costs decrease due to fewer tokens being processed. However, the ideal truncation length depends on both the classifiers and the conversation content, so it‚Äôs important to assess how truncation affects output quality before implementation. While this approach brings clear efficiency benefits, it also poses a risk: long conversations may have their most important content cut off, which can reduce classification accuracy.



Conclusion



Building a scalable, high-throughput pipeline for LLM-based classification is far from trivial. It requires navigating a constantly shifting landscape of model capabilities, prompt behaviors, and infrastructure constraints. As LLMs become faster, cheaper, and more capable, they‚Äôre unlocking new possibilities for real-time understanding of human-AI interactions at scale. The techniques we‚Äôve shared represent a snapshot of what‚Äôs working today. But more importantly, they offer a foundation for what‚Äôs possible tomorrow.

‚Ä¢ Build an intelligent eDiscovery solution using Amazon Bedrock Agents
  Legal teams spend bulk of their time manually reviewing documents during eDiscovery. This process involves analyzing electronically stored information across emails, contracts, financial records, and collaboration systems for legal proceedings. This manual approach creates significant bottlenecks: attorneys must identify privileged communications, assess legal risks, extract contractual obligations, and maintain regulatory compliance across thousands of documents per case. The process is not only resource-intensive and time-consuming, but also prone to human error when dealing with large document volumes. 
Amazon Bedrock Agents with multi-agent collaboration directly addresses these challenges by helping organizations deploy specialized AI agents that process documents in parallel while maintaining context across complex legal workflows. Instead of sequential manual review, multiple agents work simultaneously‚Äîone extracts contract terms while another identifies privileged communications, all coordinated by a central orchestrator. This approach can reduce document review time by 60‚Äì70% while maintaining the accuracy and human oversight required for legal proceedings, though actual performance varies based on document complexity and foundation model (FM) selection. 
In this post, we demonstrate how to build an intelligent eDiscovery solution using Amazon Bedrock Agents for real-time document analysis. We show how to deploy specialized agents for document classification, contract analysis, email review, and legal document processing, all working together through a multi-agent architecture. We walk through the implementation details, deployment steps, and best practices to create an extensible foundation that organizations can adapt to their specific eDiscovery requirements. 
Solution overview 
This solution demonstrates an intelligent document analysis system using Amazon Bedrock Agents with multi-agent collaboration functionality. The system uses multiple specialized agents to analyze legal documents, classify content, assess risks, and provide structured insights. The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture. 
 
The architecture diagram shows three main workflows for eDiscovery document analysis: 
 
 Real-time document analysis workflow ‚Äì Attorneys and clients (authenticated users) can upload documents and interact through mobile/web clients and chat. Documents are processed in real time for immediate analysis without persistent storage‚Äîuploaded documents are passed directly to the Amazon Bedrock Collaborator Agent endpoint. 
 Case research document analysis workflow ‚Äì This workflow is specifically for attorneys (authenticated users). It allows document review and analysis through mobile/web clients and chat. It‚Äôs focused on the legal research aspects of previously processed documents. 
 Document upload workflow ‚Äì Law firm clients (authenticated users) can upload documents through mobile/web clients. Documents are transferred by using AWS Transfer Family web apps to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket for storage. 
 
Although this architecture supports all three workflows, this post focuses specifically on implementing the real-time document analysis workflow for two key reasons: it represents the core functionality that delivers immediate value to legal teams, and it provides the foundational patterns that can be extended to support the other workflows. The real-time processing capability demonstrates the multi-agent coordination that makes this solution transformative for eDiscovery operations. 
Real-time document analysis workflow 
This workflow processes uploaded documents through coordinated AI agents, typically completing analysis within 1‚Äì2 minutes of upload. The system accelerates early case assessment by providing structured insights immediately, compared to traditional manual review that can take hours per document. The implementation coordinates five specialized agents that process different document aspects in parallel, listed in the following table.

*Processing times are estimates based on testing with Anthropic‚Äôs Claude 3.5 Haiku on Amazon Bedrock and might vary depending on document complexity and size. Actual performance in your environment may differ. 
Let‚Äôs explore an example of processing a sample legal settlement agreement. The workflow consists of the following steps: 
 
 The Collaborator Agent identifies the document as requiring both contract and legal analysis. 
 The Contract Analysis Agent extracts parties, payment terms, and obligations (40 seconds). 
 The Legal Document Analysis Agent identifies case references and precedents (30 seconds). 
 The Document Classification Agent flags confidentiality levels (10 seconds). 
 The Collaborator Agent consolidates findings into a comprehensive report (15 seconds). 
 
Total processing time is approximately 95 seconds for the sample document, compared to 2‚Äì4 hours of manual review for similar documents.

Implementation considerations 
Although Amazon Bedrock Agents significantly streamlines eDiscovery workflows, organizations should consider several key factors when implementing AI-powered document analysis solutions. Consider the following legal industry requirements for compliance and governance: 
 
 Attorney-client privilege protection ‚Äì AI systems must maintain confidentiality boundaries and can‚Äôt expose privileged communications during processing 
 Cross-jurisdictional compliance ‚Äì GDPR, CCPA, and industry-specific regulations vary by region and case type 
 Audit trail requirements ‚Äì Legal proceedings demand comprehensive processing documentation for all AI-assisted decisions 
 Professional responsibility ‚Äì Lawyers remain accountable for AI outputs and must demonstrate competency in deployed tools 
 
You might encounter technical implementation challenges, such as document processing complexity: 
 
 Variable document quality ‚Äì Scanned PDFs, handwritten annotations, and corrupted files require preprocessing strategies 
 Format diversity ‚Äì Legal documents span emails, contracts, court filings, and multimedia content requiring different processing approaches 
 Scale management ‚Äì Large cases involving over 100,000 documents require careful resource planning and concurrent processing optimization 
 
The system integration also has specific requirements: 
 
 Legacy system compatibility ‚Äì Most law firms use established case management systems that need seamless integration 
 Authentication workflows ‚Äì Multi-role access (attorneys, paralegals, clients) with different permission levels 
 AI confidence thresholds ‚Äì Determining when human review is required based on processing confidence scores 
 
Additionally, consider your human/AI collaboration framework. The most successful eDiscovery implementations maintain human oversight at critical decision points. Although Amazon Bedrock Agents excels at automating routine tasks like document classification and metadata extraction, legal professionals remain essential for the following factors: 
 
 Complex legal interpretations requiring contextual understanding 
 Privilege determinations that impact case strategy 
 Quality control of AI-generated insights 
 Strategic analysis of document relationships and case implications 
 
This collaborative approach optimizes the eDiscovery process‚ÄîAI handles time-consuming data processing while legal professionals focus on high-stakes decisions requiring human judgment and expertise. For your implementation strategy, consider a phased deployment approach. Organizations should implement staged rollouts to minimize risk while building confidence: 
 
 Pilot programs using lower-risk document categories (routine correspondence, standard contracts) 
 Controlled expansion with specialized agents and broader user base 
 Full deployment enabling complete multi-agent collaboration organization-wide 
 
Lastly, consider the following success planning best practices: 
 
 Establish clear governance frameworks for model updates and version control 
 Create standardized testing protocols for new agent deployments 
 Develop escalation procedures for edge cases requiring human intervention 
 Implement parallel processing during validation periods to maintain accuracy 
 
By addressing these considerations upfront, legal teams can facilitate smoother implementation and maximize the benefits of AI-powered document analysis while maintaining the accuracy and oversight required for legal proceedings. 
Clean up 
If you decide to discontinue using the solution, complete the following steps to remove it and its associated resources deployed using AWS CloudFormation: 
 
 On the AWS CloudFormation console, choose Stacks in the navigation pane. 
 Locate the stack you created during the deployment process (you assigned a name to it). 
 Select the stack and choose Delete. 
 
Results 
Amazon Bedrock Agents transforms eDiscovery from time-intensive manual processes into efficient AI-powered operations, delivering measurable operational improvements across business services organizations. With a multi-agent architecture, organizations can process documents in 1‚Äì2 minutes compared to 2‚Äì4 hours of manual review for similar documents, achieving a 60‚Äì70% reduction in review time while maintaining accuracy and compliance requirements. A representative implementation from the financial services sector demonstrates this transformative potential: a major institution transformed their compliance review process from a 448-page manual workflow requiring over 10,000 hours to an automated system that reduced external audit times from 1,000 to 300‚Äì400 hours and internal audits from 800 to 320‚Äì400 hours. The institution now conducts 30‚Äì40 internal reviews annually with existing staff while achieving greater accuracy and consistency across assessments. These results demonstrate the potential across implementations: organizations implementing this solution can progress from initial efficiency gains in pilot phases to a 60‚Äì70% reduction in review time at full deployment. Beyond time savings, the solution delivers strategic advantages, including resource optimization that helps legal professionals focus on high-value analysis rather than routine document processing, improved compliance posture through systematic identification of privileged communications, and future-ready infrastructure that adapts to evolving legal technology requirements.

‚Ä¢ How PerformLine uses prompt engineering on Amazon Bedrock to detect compliance violations
  This post is co-written with Bogdan Arsenie and Nick Mattei from PerformLine. 
PerformLine operates within the marketing compliance industry, a specialized subset of the broader compliance software market, which includes various compliance solutions like anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and others. Specifically, marketing compliance refers to adhering to regulations and guidelines set by government agencies that make sure a company‚Äôs marketing, advertising, and sales content and communications are truthful, accurate, and not misleading for consumers. PerformLine is the leading service providing comprehensive compliance oversight across marketing, sales, and partner channels. As pioneers of the marketing compliance industry, PerformLine has conducted over 1.1 billion compliance observations over the past 10+ years, automating the entire compliance process‚Äîfrom pre-publication review of materials to continuous monitoring of consumer-facing channels such as websites, emails, and social media. Trusted by consumer finance brands and global organizations, PerformLine uses AI-driven solutions to protect brands and their consumers, transforming compliance efforts into a competitive advantage. 
‚ÄúDiscover. Monitor. Act. This isn‚Äôt just our tagline‚Äîit‚Äôs the foundation of our innovation at PerformLine,‚Äù&nbsp;says PerformLine‚Äôs CTO Bogdan Arsenie. PerformLine‚Äôs engineering team brings these principles to life by developing AI-powered technology solutions. In this post, PerformLine and AWS explore how PerformLine used Amazon&nbsp;Bedrock to accelerate compliance processes, generate actionable insights, and provide contextual data‚Äîdelivering the speed and accuracy essential for large-scale oversight. 
The problem 
One of PerformLine‚Äôs enterprise customers needed a more efficient process for running compliance checks on newly launched product pages, particularly those that integrate multiple products within the same visual and textual framework. These complex pages often feature overlapping content that can apply to one product, several products, or even all of them at once, necessitating a context-aware interpretation that mirrors how a typical consumer would view and interact with the content. By adopting AWS and the&nbsp;architecture discussed in this post, PerformLine can retrieve and analyze these intricate pages through AI-driven processing, generating detailed insights and contextual data that capture the nuanced interplay between various product elements. After the relevant information is extracted and structured, it‚Äôs fed directly into their rules engine, enabling robust compliance checks. This accomplishes a seamless flow, from data ingestion to rules-based analysis. It not only preserves the depth of each product‚Äôs presentation but also delivers the speed and accuracy critical to large-scale oversight.&nbsp;Monitoring millions of webpages daily for compliance demands a system that can intelligently parse, extract, and analyze content at scale‚Äîmuch like the approach PerformLine has developed for their enterprise customers. In this dynamic landscape, the ever-evolving nature of web content challenges traditional static parsing, requiring a context-aware and adaptive solution. This architecture not only processes bulk data offline but also delivers near real-time performance for one-time requests, dynamically scaling to manage the diverse complexity of each page. By using AI-powered inference, PerformLine provides comprehensive coverage of every product and marketing element across the web, while striking a careful balance between accuracy, performance, and cost. 
Solution overview 
With this flexible, adaptable solution, PerformLine can tackle even the most challenging webpages, providing comprehensive coverage when extracting and analyzing web content with multiple products. At the same time, by combining consistency with the adaptability of foundation models (FMs), PerformLine can maintain reliable performance across the diverse range of products and websites their customers monitor. This dual focus on agility and operational consistency makes sure their customers benefit from robust compliance checks and data integrity, without sacrificing the speed or scale needed to remain competitive. 
PerformLine‚Äôs upstream ingestion pipeline efficiently collects millions of web pages and their associated metadata in a batch process. Downstream assets are submitted to&nbsp;PerformLine‚Äôs rules engine and compliance review processes. It was imperative that they not disrupt those processes or introduce cascading changes for this solution. 
PerformLine decided to use generative AI and Amazon&nbsp;Bedrock to address their core challenges. Amazon Bedrock allows for a&nbsp;broad selection of models, including Amazon Nova. Amazon Bedrock is continuously expanding feature sets around using FMs at scale. This provides a reliable foundation to build a highly available&nbsp;and efficient content processing system. 
PerformLine‚Äôs solution incorporates the following key components: 
 
 AI inference with Amazon&nbsp;Bedrock ‚Äì&nbsp;Provides seamless access to FMs for content extraction and analysis 
 Application inference profiles&nbsp;‚Äì&nbsp;Enables precise tracking and optimization of inference costs 
 Event-driven serverless processing pipeline ‚ÄìProvides a lightweight, scalable approach to handling dynamic workloads using Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), AWS Lambda, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon DynamoDB. 
 Prompt management in Bedrock&nbsp;‚Äì&nbsp;Supports versioning, testing, and deployment of prompts for improved AI consistency and control 
 Task orchestration ‚Äì&nbsp;Uses Amazon SQS to manage work queues efficiently, facilitating smooth and scalable task execution 
 
PerformLine&nbsp;implemented a scalable, serverless event-driven architecture (shown in the following diagram) that seamlessly integrates with their existing system, requiring less than a day&nbsp;to develop and deploy. This made it possible to focus on prompt optimization, evaluation, and cost management rather than infrastructure overhead.&nbsp;This architecture allows&nbsp;PerformLine&nbsp;to dynamically parse, extract, and analyze web content with high reliability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency. 

 
 The system implements multiple queue types (Incoming, DLQ, Results) and includes error handling mechanisms. Data flows through various AWS services including: Amazon RDS for initial data storage Amazon MQ RabbitMQ for message handling Amazon S3 for asset storage Amazon EventBridge for event management Amazon SQS for queue management AWS Lambda for serverless processing Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage
 
PerformLine‚Äôs process consists of several steps, including processing (Step 1), event trigger and storage (Steps 2‚Äì6), structured output and storage (Step 7), and downstream processing and compliance checks (Steps 8‚Äì9): 
 
 Millions of pages are processed by an upstream extract, transform, and load (ETL) process from PerformLine‚Äôs core systems running on the AWS Cloud. 
 When a page is retrieved, it triggers an event in the compliance check system. 
 Amazon S3 allows for storage of the data from a page according to metadata. 
 EventBridge uses&nbsp;event-driven processing to route Amazon S3 events to Amazon SQS. 
 Amazon SQS queues messages for processing&nbsp;and enables messages to be retried on failure. 
 A Lambda Function consumes SQS messages and also scales dynamically to handle even unpredictable workloads: 
   
   This function uses Amazon Bedrock&nbsp;to perform extraction and generative AI analysis of the content from Amazon SQS. Amazon Bedrock offers the greatest flexibility to choose the right model for the job. For PerformLine‚Äôs use case, Amazon‚Äôs Nova Pro was best suited for complex requests that require a powerful model but still allows for a high performance to cost ratio. Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Haiku model&nbsp;allows for optimized quick calls, where a fast response is paramount for additional processing if needed. Amazon Bedrock features, including Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management and inference profiles are used to increase input code variability without affecting output and reduce complexity in usage of FMs through Amazon Bedrock. 
   The function stores customer-defined product schemas in Amazon&nbsp;DynamoDB, enabling dynamic large language model (LLM) targeting and schema-driven output generation. 
    
 Amazon S3 stores the extracted data, which is formatted as structured JSON adhering to the target schema. 
 EventBridge forwards Amazon S3 events to Amazon SQS, making extracted data available for downstream processing. 
 Compliance checks and business rules, running on other PerformLine‚Äôs systems, are applied to validate and enforce regulatory requirements. 
 
Cost optimizations 
The solution offers several cost optimizations, including change data capture (CDC) on the web and strategic multi-pass inference. After a page‚Äôs content has been analyzed and formatted, it‚Äôs written back to a partition that includes a metadata hash of the asset. This enables upstream processes to determine whether a page has already been processed and if its content has changed. The key benefits of this approach include: 
 
 Alleviating redundant processing of the same pages, contributing to PerformLine experiencing a 15% workload reduction in human evaluation tasks. This frees&nbsp;time for human evaluators and allows them focus on critical pages rather than all the pages. 
 Avoiding reprocessing unchanged pages, dynamically reducing PerformLine‚Äôs analysts‚Äô workload by over 50% in addition to deduplication gains. 
 
LLM inference costs can escalate at scale, but context and carefully structured prompts are critical for accuracy. To optimize costs while maintaining precision, PerformLine implemented a multi-pass approach using Amazon&nbsp;Bedrock: 
 
 Initial filtering with Amazon Nova Micro ‚Äì This lightweight model efficiently identifies relevant products with minimal cost. 
 Targeted extraction with Amazon Nova Lite ‚Äì Identified products are batched into smaller groups and passed to Amazon Nova Lite for deeper analysis. This keeps PerformLine within token limits while improving extraction accuracy. 
 Increased accuracy through context-aware processing ‚Äì By first identifying the target content and then processing it in smaller batches, PerformLine significantly improved accuracy while minimizing token consumption. 
 
Use of Amazon Bedrock 
During initial testing, PerformLine quickly realized the need for a more scalable approach to prompt management. Manually tracking multiple prompt versions and templates became inefficient as PerformLine iterated and collaborated. 
Amazon Bedrock‚Äôs Prompt Management service provided a centralized solution, enabling them to version, manage, and seamlessly deploy prompts to production. After the prompts are deployed, they can be dynamically referenced in AWS Lambda, allowing for flexible configuration. Additionally, by using Amazon&nbsp;Bedrock application profile inference endpoints, PerformLine can dynamically adjust the models the Lambda function invokes, track cost per invocation, and attribute costs to specific application instances through setting up cost tags. 
To streamline model interactions, PerformLine chose the Amazon Bedrock Converse API which provides a developer-friendly, standardized interface for model invocation. When combined with inference endpoints and prompt management, a Lambda function using the Amazon Bedrock Converse API becomes highly configurable‚ÄîPerformLine developers can&nbsp;rapidly test new models and prompts, evaluate results, and iterate without needing to rebuild or redeploy. The simplification of prompt management and ability to deploy various models through Amazon Bedrock is shown in the following diagram. 

 
 Comprehensive AWS ML model configuration architecture highlighting three main components: Inference System: Model ID integration Profile configuration Content management Inference settings Prompt Management: Version control (V1 and Draft versions) Publish ID tracking Model A specifications Store configurations Environment Control: Separate PROD and DEV paths Environment-specific parameter stores Invoke ID management Engineering iteration tracking
 
Future plans and enhancements 
PerformLine is excited to dive into additional Amazon Bedrock features, including prompt caching&nbsp;and Amazon Bedrock Flows. 
With prompt caching, users can checkpoint prompt tokens, effectively caching context for reuse in subsequent API calls. Prompt caching on Amazon Bedrock offers up to 85% latency improvements and 90% cost reduction in comparison to calls without prompt caching. PerformLine sees prompt caching as a feature that will become the standard moving forward. They have a number of use cases for their data, and having the ability to apply further analysis on the same content at a lower cost creates new opportunities for feature expansion and development. 
Amazon Bedrock Flows is a visual workflow builder that enables users to orchestrate multi-step generative AI tasks by connecting FMs and APIs without extensive coding. Amazon Bedrock Flows is a next step in simplifying PerformLine‚Äôs orchestration of knowledge bases, prompt caching, and even Amazon Bedrock agents in the future. Creating flows can help reduce time to feature deployment and maintenance. 
Summary 
PerformLine has&nbsp;implemented a highly scalable, serverless, AI-driven architecture that enhances efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and compliance in the web content processing pipeline. By using Amazon Bedrock, EventBridge, Amazon SQS, Lambda, and DynamoDB, they have built a solution that can dynamically scale, optimize AI inference costs, and reduce redundant processing‚Äîall while maintaining operational flexibility and compliance integrity.&nbsp;Based on their current volume and workflow, PerformLine is projected to process between 1.5 to 2 million pages daily, from which they expect to extract approximately 400,000 to 500,000 products. Additionally, PerformLine anticipates applying rules to each asset, resulting in about 500,000 rule observations that will require review each day.Throughout the design process&nbsp;PerformLine made sure their solution remains as simple as possible while still delivering operational flexibility and integrity. This approach minimizes complexity, enhances maintainability, and accelerates deployment, empowering them to adapt quickly to evolving business needs without unnecessary overhead. 
By using a serverless AI-driven architecture built on Amazon Bedrock, PerformLine helps their customers tackle even the most complex, multi-product webpages with unparalleled accuracy and efficiency. This holistic approach interprets visual and textual elements as a typical consumer would, verifying that every product variant is accurately assessed for compliance. The resulting insights are then fed directly into a rules engine, enabling rapid, data-driven decisions. For PerformLine‚Äôs customers, this means less redundant processing, lower operational costs, and a dramatically simplified compliance workflow, all without compromising on speed or accuracy. By reducing the overhead of large-scale data analysis and streamlining compliance checks, PerformLine‚Äôs solution ultimately frees teams to focus on driving innovation and delivering value.
